Poompatta (Malayalam: "പൂമ്പാറ്റ" butterfly) is a Malayalam children's magazine started publishing in 1964. It was initially owned by P. A. Warrier and later by Pai and Pai Company. N M Mohan (1978-82) and R. Gopalakrishnan (1982-1986) were edited this magazine. Before the rise of the "Balarama" magazine, it was the market leader among the Malayalam comic magazines. Now the magazine is published from Thrissur by Sooryaprabha Publications, Thrissur.

"Poompatta" is considered as "one of the pioneering children’s magazines in Malayalam". It used to feature the cartoon "Undaappikkal" - which very closely resemble the minions from Despicable Me though it was published many years before the movie. Other notable graphic novels titled " Pankathanthram Kathakal", "Kaloolu", "Kishkku","Professor uncle" were regularly published in the magazine.

Barringun, Queensland

Barringun is a rural locality in Paroo Shire, Queensland, Australia, on the border with New South Wales. Barringun is also the capital of the self-proclaimed Murrawarri Republic.

The name "Barringun" derives from an early settlement (possibly a pastoral station) on the Warrego River, which can be seen on an 1887 map as being just south of the New South Wales border. It is possibly an Aboriginal word meaning "fish die in the water".

Barringun has a heritage-listed site: East Bank, Warrego River at the border with New South Wales: Zero Obelisk

Mataz

Mataz (Circassian: Мэтазэ), often called as psyhaluje or haluš (Circassian: Псыхьалыжъо), are filled dumplings in Circassian cuisine. They are made by wrapping pockets of unleavened dough around a filling and cooking them in boiling water. 

The dough, which is made by mixing flour and warm water, sometimes with an egg, is rolled flat and then cut into squares with a knife or circles using a cup or drinking glass. It may be stuffed with mashed potatoes and fried onions. Typically, these dumplings also consist (singularly or in combinations) of a spiced meat mixture, usually lamb or ground beef, with greens, sauerkraut, and onions, put in a dough wrapper, either boiled or steamed. Mushrooms or cheese may be used in place of meat.

Closely related to halušky and pierogi (varenyky), psyhaluje may be served with a topping, such as melted butter, fried onion, or combinations of these ingredients. Sour cream and yoghurt are non-traditional options.

To the End of the Earth

"To the End of the Earth" is a song recorded by Australian singer Jessica Mauboy. The song was digitally released on 17 July 2013, as the lead single from Mauboy's third studio album "Beautiful". It was written by Mauboy, Jaden Michaels, Ben Berger and Ryan McMahon, and produced by the latter two. The uptempo dance-pop song received positive reviews from critics, who commended the production. "To the End of the Earth" peaked at number 21 on the ARIA Singles Chart and was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association for selling over 35,000 copies. The track was promoted by performances at the 2013 State of Origin decider, on "Sunrise" and at Westfield Knox and Westfield Hurstville. The accompanying music video was directed by Emma Tomelty and filmed in Alice Springs. The video received a positive reception from critics, particularly for its presentation.

"To the End of the Earth" was written by Jessica Mauboy, Jaden Michaels, Ben Berger and Ryan McMahon. The production was handled by Berger and McMahon of Captain Cuts, who are known for remixing tracks for Britney Spears, Ellie Goulding and Marina and the Diamonds. Mauboy's vocals were recorded at Captain Cuts Studios in Los Angeles, California. The song was engineered by Captain Cuts and mixed by Miles Walker. It was mastered by Tom Coyne at Sterling Sound in New York City. The uptempo dance-pop song was inspired by Mauboy being homesick. She told News Limited, "I was two weeks into the writing session and wanted to write something about home. I was missing home a lot. 'To the End of the Earth' made sense because everything I do connects to back home, to my place in the world." During the sessions, Mauboy asked the producers to make changes to the song, which included removing the dubstep beats to focus more on her voice. 

"To the End of the Earth" was made available for digital purchase on 17 July 2013. A CD single was released on 2 August 2013; it includes two remixes of "To the End of the Earth", the bonus track "Over and Over", and a 6 panel fold-out poster.

"To the End of the Earth" received positive reviews from critics. Mike Wass from Idolator described it as a "killer dance track" and noted that Mauboy's "powerful pipes aren't overpowered by the slick house beats and the towering chorus will be a hit in clubs and on radio." "Take 40 Australia" wrote that the song "definitely has a super catchy big pop sound!", while Lars Brandle from "Billboard" magazine noted it as a "club-vibe song." Chris Urankar from "InStyle" magazine called the track a "euphoric dance-pop ditty" that features "infectious, Calvin Harris-style beats." Adam Bub from Ninemsn's TheFix viewed "To the End of the Earth" as a "sizzling new dance anthem" and added that fellow Australian singer Kylie Minogue should watch out. 

"The Music Network" noted it as "a decidedly different sounding track" from Mauboy's "'60s-leaning soul vocals" on "The Sapphires" soundtrack. "To the End of the Earth" earned Mauboy the Best Female Artist accolade at the 2013 ARIA Music Awards, and was nominated for "World's Best Song" at the 2014 World Music Awards. Upon its release, the song debuted at number 22 on the ARIA Singles Chart issue dated 29 July 2013, but fell to number 32 the following week. It peaked at number 21 in the issue dated 12 August 2013. "To the End of the Earth" was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association for selling over 35,000 copies.

The accompanying music video was directed by Emma Tomelty, who previously directed the music videos for Ricki-Lee's "Do It Like That" and Hermitude's "Speak of the Devil". It was filmed in July 2013 at several locations around Alice Springs including the West MacDonnell National Park. The electric blue 1969 Holden Monaro used in the video belonged to local sheet metal worker Jack Speares. Model Delroy Craig portrayed Mauboy's love interest in the video. A teaser of the clip, which featured scenes of Mauboy singing in a desert and being intimate with her love interest, was shown on "Sunrise" on 2 August 2013. A second teaser was posted on YouTube on 4 August 2013 and featured Mauboy singing in front of a rippling sheet in the desert. The official video clip was uploaded to Mauboy's Vevo account the following day. 

The video begins with Craig driving a Holden Monaro while Mauboy sits in the passenger seat; Craig stops the vehicle on the side of an after-dark highway. As the song begins, Mauboy exits the car and does a teasing dance for him in front of the car with the headlights on. The video then changes to daytime and features intimate scenes of Mauboy and Craig on the bonnet of the car, as well scenes of Mauboy singing in the desert and at the rock formations of Standley Chasm. Towards the end of the video, Mauboy is seen singing on top of a rocky mountain range. 

Mike Wass from Idolator called it an "epic video" and wrote, "Not only does the rugged landscape offer a striking backdrop for a music video, it also works as an unintentional advert for tourism Australia." Chris Urankar from "InStyle" described the video as an "earthy and epic piece." Nova FM praised Mauboy's love interest in the video, calling him "smoking hot." Adam Bub from TheFix also praised her love interest by calling him a "spunky model", and noted that Mauboy "is at her most beautiful in the lavishly produced clip."

Mauboy performed "To the End of the Earth" for the first time at the 2013 State of Origin decider, held at ANZ Stadium in Sydney on 17 July 2013. She performed, with backup dancers wearing leather outfits, to a crowd of more than 82,000 prior to the game's kick-off. According to Armchair Guru from Sports Banter, Mauboy lip-synched her performance. She also performed the track on "Sunrise" (30 July 2013) and during instore appearances at Westfield Knox in Wantirna South, Victoria (2 August 2013) and Westfield Hurstville in Hurstville, New South Wales (8 August 2013). "To the End of the Earth" was also part of the set list of Mauboy's To the End of the Earth Tour.

Lottie Briscoe

Lottie Briscoe (April 19, 1883 – March 21, 1950) was an American stage and silent screen actress. She began in theatre at the age of four and as an adult was among the first to find success after making the transition from the legitimate stage to cinema. Briscoe appeared in over 94 motion pictures; she is perhaps best remembered for her time at Lubin Studios with co-star Arthur V. Johnson.

Lottie Briscoe was born in St. Louis, Missouri to Mr. and Mrs. T. D. Briscoe. Her father may have been involved in theatre work and her mother was known to the theatre community as a likable stage mother. A sister, Olive Helen Briscoe, had long a career in vaudeville as a singer and comedian.

Briscoe first appeared on stage at the age of four, and by nine she was touring as Editha in Gus Thomas’ adaptation of Frances Burnett’s children’s story " Editha’s Burglar". Three years later, in June 1895, she was engaged at the Fifth Avenue Theatre, New York, to play Julian Esmond in the Russ Whytal melodrama "For Fair Virginia", but was replaced after just two nights when the mayor’s office determined that the weather was too hot for a child under sixteen to be working in. Briscoe eventually did return to "For Fair Virginia" to play Julian Esmond over a subsequent road tour that lasted well into the spring of 1897. By October 1897 Briscoe was back at the Fifth Avenue Theatre with Richard Mansfield's company as Essie in the American debut of Shaw's "The Devil’s Disciple". In 1899 she toured with Walter E. Perkins playing Gertie in a farce-comedy entitled "My Friend from India" by Henry A. Du Souchet.

During the 1900–1901 season Briscoe assumed the role of the sickly boy Claude in a national tour of "Two Little Vagrants", Charles Klein's adaptation of the Pierre Decourcelle melodrama "Les Deux Gosses". The following season she began a long tour playing Asa opposite Paul Gilmore in "Lost River"; advertised as a pastoral melodrama by Joseph Arthur. In 1905 Briscoe toured in the Harry McRae Webster military drama "Lieutenant Dick, U. S. A." playing Machita to Webster’s Sergeant Jones. At some point around this time Briscoe and Webster were married.

Around 1909 Briscoe, along with Harry McRae Webster, joined the fledgling Essanay Studios, Chicago. At least two films during this period, both one-reelers from January 1911, are known to exist today; "The Sophomore’s Romance" and "A Sin Unpardonable". In June 1911 she played Zenia in Essanay's "His Friend's Wife", remembered for Francis X. Bushman's film debut. Her peak years were with Lubin Studios in short films that often cast her with the actor-director Arthur V. Johnson. Their most ambitious project together during this period was probably "The Belovéd Adventurer" (1914), a 15-episode serial written by Emmett Campbell Hall. When Johnson died in January 1916, shortly after the release of their latest film, the Maie B. Hovey story "The Lost Rose", Briscoe left film and did not return until 1918, and then only briefly to play Gertie Farish in "The House of Mirth".

In 1919 Briscoe began a long run in vaudeville playing the title role in a domestic comedy by George Kelly entitled "Mrs. Wellington's Surprise". That October 19 she was among a group of celebrities who performed at the Manhattan Opera House in a benefit on behalf of the Chelsea Memorial Association in raising funds for the Chelsea Park Memorial in Manhattan. One of a number of such memorials erected in the city during this time honoring local residents who gave their lives during the First World War. In February 1922 Briscoe signed to appear in a leading role with William Faversham in the The Squaw Man. At some point in the not too distant future serious health issues would leave Briscoe homebound for the remainder of her life.

Harry McRae Webster became a motion picture director of some note before he was sued in the early 1920s by a film studio over the unauthorized use of nude models in one of his movies. Her second husband, Harry Mountford, served as a longtime executive secretary for the White Rats actor's union.

Briscoe died on March 21, 1950, in New York, and her husband died on June 5, 1950.

Wadi el-Natrun prison

The Wadi el-Natrun prison is an Egyptian prison complex in the Beheira Governorate, north of Cairo. It consists of two separate facilities 5 kilometers apart.

The prison was used to incarcerate Islamists and other political prisoners under the regime of Hosni Mubarak and after the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, several prominent Muslim Brotherhood activists were imprisoned there. On 30 January 2011, thousands of prisoners were helped to escape from the prison. Some prisoners have suggested that those responsible for freeing them were in fact police officers acting under Interior Ministry orders, though a June 2013 court concluded that Hamas and Hezbollah worked with the Muslim Brotherhood to orchestrate the jailbreak. 34 Brotherhood activists, including the future president Mohamed Morsi and Saad El-Katatni, were among those who escaped from the prison. After the coup against Morsi in July 2013, Morsi faced trial for his role in the prison break. He and 105 others were sentenced to death on 16 May 2015. The court of cassation in November 2016 overturned the death sentence on Morsi and five other Muslim Brotherhood members and then ordered a retrial for the similar charges.

Structurally, O-1871 is a cyclohexylphenol derivative related to CP 47,497, and so is illegal in most jurisdictions where CP 47,497 and its derivatives are banned. However the 3,3-dimethylcyclohexyl substituent of O-1871 can be replaced by various other groups, producing other potent compounds such as the cycloheptyl derivative O-1656 and the 2-adamantyl derivative O-1660, as well as the corresponding 3,5-dichlorophenyl derivative, which are not cyclohexylphenol derivatives.

The site includes over 200 petroglyphs created by Paiute inhabitants of the region between 2950 B.C. and 1850 A.D. A wide array of design elements were used in the petroglyphs; the majority are abstract curved figures, but abstract lines, anthropomorphs, human and animal tracks, and cupules are also present. The site also includes remnants of human inhabitation, such as stacks of rocks thought to signify house sites, stone tools, ceramics, and animal remains.

The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. The National Park Service has not disclosed the exact location of the site due to its sensitive nature.

Casseurs Flowters

Casseurs Flowters () is a French hip hop duo established in 2004 by rappers Orelsan and Gringe. The duo's name is a reference to the two "Wet Bandits" from the movie "Home Alone", called the ""Casseurs Flotteurs"" in the French dialogue.

The two rappers met in the year 2000 in Paris. "Les Inrocks" describe their meeting as being "as simple as a Franck Dumas match analysis."

Casseurs Flowters released their first mixtape "Fantasy: Episode 1" with 11 tracks, with help from French record producer Skread, in 2004. Afterwards, the two rappers decided to focus on building their solo careers, with Orelsan releasing "Perdu d'avance" in 2009 and "Le chant des sirènes" in 2011, his first two studio albums, and Gringe releasing a mixtape entitled "Fantasy Mixtape" in 2009.

Following the success of Orelsan's second studio album "Le chant des sirènes", the duo released their first collaborative single, "Bloqué", on 3 July 2013, as a pre-release for their upcoming debut studio album, "Orelsan et Gringe sont les Casseurs Flowters", which was released on 15 November 2013 to generally positive reviews.

Gringe has released a number of independent materials and has collaborated with a number of artists such as El Matador, Brasco, Pit Baccardi, La Province, Jamal and Nubi.

Orelsan has also released a number of other independent materials, notably the "Zéro EP" with 14 tracks that included five tracks featuring his work with Gringe as Casseurs Flowters, namely "Arrêtes", "Toc Toc", "Mauvaises ondes", "Venu pour flowter" and "J'vais baiser ta femme".

Parkhurst, Queensland

Parkhurst is a suburb of Rockhampton in the Rockhampton Region, Queensland, Australia. At the 2011 Australian Census the suburb recorded a population of 1,385.

Parkhurst is bounded to the north by Ramsay Creek and to the west by Ramsay Creek and then the Fitzroy River. To the south it is bounded by Limestone Creek (the creek, not the suburb) and by Yeppoon Road.

A section of the Bruce Highway passes through the centre of the suburb from south to north, while the North Coast railway line also passes through the suburb from south to north, to the west of the highway.

The Parkhurst Industrial Estate is in the south-west of the suburb, while the residential land is in the west near the river and in the north-east of the suburb. Most of Parkhurst remains farmland, but Rockhampton's urban sprawl has led to further residential developments being established throughout Parkhurst including the Northridge, Rosedale, Paramount Park, Riverside and Edenbrook estates.

The increasing population at Parkhurst and in areas further north such as Rockyview and Glendale has led to the construction of the Parkhurst Town Centre, a new shopping centre anchored by a Woolworths supermarket. Construction of the centre commenced in August 2015. Woolworths was the first store in open in the centre on 15 November 2016. 

The land near the river is prone to flooding. Rockhampton's water treatment facility is located near the river.

The Glenmore Homestead is one of the earliest in the Rockhampon area, being established in the late 1850s. Land was opened up for settlement and small farms were established.

Parkhurst Provisional School accepted its first enrolments on 11 June 1900. In 1909 it became Parkhurst State School. 

Parkhurst has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:

Parkhurst is home to the Rockhampton Heritage Village. Located at 296 Boundary Road, this open air museum showcases a range of historic buildings with exhibitions of artefacts from Rockhampton's history. The museum is a venue for local markets and has a large function venue built in the style of a traditional woolshed.

Limestone Creek Environmental Park offers a range of walking tracks in and around Limestone Creek through an open eucalypt forest where wildlife can be seen. It is popular with bird watchers and photographers.

Parkhurst Early Learning Centre is a child care and early childhood education centre which has been operating in the suburb since 1995. The centre in Bean Avenue currently has a capacity to cater for 99 children per day which was increased after a purpose-built kindergarten building was added to the original centre. Along with providing care for infants and toddlers, the centre offers an approved 24-space kindergarten program. The centre also provides daily before-school and after-school care for primary school aged children, and vacation care during school holidays. 

Parkhurst State School is a state primary school (P-6) located on Mason Avenue. In 2014, the school had an enrolment of 308 students with 25 teachers (21 full-time equivalent). The school motto is 'Every Parkhurst learner is literate, numerate, safe, happy and learning every day.' 
Approximately half the children live outside the suburb and come from the more rural areas to the north via a school bus.

While there is no high school located at Parkhurst, Heights College and Glenmore State High School at Kawana are located to the south and are the nearest schools to Parkhurst which offer secondary education.

The grounds of the North Rockhampton campus of Central Queensland University are located adjacent to Parkhurst, and the university suggests Parkhurst as one of the conveniently located suburbs for students looking for accommodation near the campus.

Håkon Lorentzen

Håkon Holmefjord Lorentzen (born 2 August 1997) is a Norwegian footballer who plays for Sandefjord. Speed skater Håvard Lorentzen is an older brother of Håkon.

Lorentzen was born in Bergen, and is the younger brother of the 2012 World Junior Speed Skating Championships winner Håvard Lorentzen. They also have an older brother, and the three brothers grew up competing in speed skating and football during their youth. Håkon Lorentzen played football for Løv-Ham and was at an early age a talented footballer and was selected for the club's youth academy.

Lorentzen transferred to Brann ahead of the 2012 season, and was allowed to play senior football for the club's third team in the 4. Divisjon despite his young age. In 2013, Lorentzen played for Brann's reserve team in the 2. Divisjon in 2013, where he scored his first goal in the 1–0 win against Fyllingsdalen. He was then rewarded a spot in the squad for the first team's match against Start on 9 May 2013. He became the youngest-ever Brann-player, aged 15 years and 280 days when he replaced Erik Huseklepp in the match against IK Start. Lorentzen made his debut in Tippeligaen the same day as the Molde player Sander Svendsen, who is four days younger than Lorentzen. Neither of the two are however the youngest-ever player in Tippeligaen, as Zymer Bytyqi made his debut for Sandnes Ulf at the age of 15 years and 261 days in the 2013 season.

He signed his first professional contract with Brann in July 2013. He signed a three-year contract and became the youngest-ever player to sign a professional contract with the club. In the decisive match of the 2013 season, Lorentzen made another appearance as a substitute when Tromsø was beaten 4–1. He scored Brann's last goal, and became the youngest-ever goalscorer in Tippeligaen. That record was previously held by Ohi Omoijuanfo, who was 16 years and 300 days when he scored for Lillestrøm against Strømsgodset in the 2010 season, and has since been broken by Martin Ødegaard.

Lorentzen signed a 5-month loan-deal with Åsane.

Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013

The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 (; Act No.35 of 2013; previously Bill No.66 of 2013) is an Act of the Oireachtas which defines the circumstances and processes within which abortion in Ireland can be legally performed. The Act gives effect in statutory law to the terms of the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the 1992 judgment "Attorney General v. X" (the "X case"). That judgment allowed for abortion where pregnancy endangers a woman's life, including through a risk of suicide. The provisions relating to suicide have been the most contentious part of the bill. Having passed both Houses of the Oireachtas in July 2013, it was signed into law on 30 July by Michael D. Higgins, the President of Ireland, and commenced on 1 January 2014.

Under section 58 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861, unlawfully attempting to procure a miscarriage was a crime punishable by up to life imprisonment. A 1983 amendment to the 1937 Constitution guarantees to vindicate the "right to life of the unborn" with due regard for "the equal right to life of the mother". Proponents of the amendment believed that it would guarantee abortion could never be allowed in any circumstances. However, in 1992 the Supreme Court ruled in "Attorney General v. X" that abortion was permitted where pregnancy presented "a real and substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother", including where the risk was through suicide. There were two attempts to amend the Constitution to explicitly rule out suicide as grounds for abortion. These were rejected at referendums in 1992 and in 2002; some no-voters felt the restriction was too strong and others that it was not strong enough. No legislation was passed to amend the 1861 act in the light of the 1992 judgment.

In December 2010, in the case "A, B and C v Ireland", the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) ruled that the state had infringed a complainant's rights by not providing clear information on whether she was entitled to an abortion. The state had a year to respond officially, and after the 2011 general election, the new coalition government decided in December 2011 to appoint an expert group to advise on how to implement the ECtHR judgment. The committee reported in November 2012, offering four possibilities: 1) non-statutory guidelines 2) statutory regulations 3) legislation only and 4) legislation plus regulations. Following the death of Savita Halappanavar in Galway on 28 October 2012 of maternal septicemia after a miscarriage, her husband and friends told local pro-choice groups they blamed her death on the denial of her request for an abortion; "The Irish Times" broke the story on 12 November and it fed into the wider abortion debate. In December, the government decided to pursue option 4 in the expert group's report: legislation plus regulations.

The Act specifies the number and specialty of medical practitioners who must concur that a termination is necessary to prevent a risk of death. These criteria differ in three scenarios:

The physicians' diagnosis must be "an opinion formed in good faith which has regard to the need to preserve unborn human life as far as practicable". Normal informed consent is required. Medical personnel with conscience objections to abortion will not be required to participate in terminations, but must transfer care of a patient in such cases. All terminations must be notified to the Minister for Health within 28 days. The Minister will make an annual report of such notifications.

Where a termination is requested but refused, a woman may appeal to the Health Service Executive (HSE). The HSE will establish a panel of at least 10 physicians, from whom a committee of two or three will review any application within three days. The committee members' specialties will depend on whether the condition is physical or mental, in the same way as for the initial assessment. The HSE must publish an annual report on the review process.

The Act also repeals sections 58 and 59 of the 1861 act; these criminalise attempted or actual procurement of miscarriage, and assisting such procurement. It replaces them with a new offence of "destruction of unborn human life", with a maximum penalty of 14 years' imprisonment. The director of a body corporate which performs such a procedure can be guilty of a similar offence. As required by the Constitution, the right to travel abroad for abortion (13th amendment), and to provide information about foreign abortion (14th amendment), are protected.

The Act defines the "unborn" whose life is protected as existing from implantation in the uterus until "complete emergence ... from the body of the woman". Beginning at implantation conforms to a 2009 Supreme Court judgment on the beginning of pregnancy, rather than the Catholic view that personhood begins at conception. The aim of specifying the uterus is to avoid criminalising emergency contraception or treatment of ectopic pregnancy.

The Act empowers the Minister for Health to produce regulations detailing the procedures for all its provisions.

A "senior source" at the National Maternity Hospital (NMH) told "The Irish Times" that terminations had been carried out there prior to the 2013 Act, and that the change brought about by the Act would be to remove the "fear of a possible Medical Council case".

Except in an emergency, a termination can only be carried out in an "appropriate institution". The Act lists several of these, and empowers the Minister to specify others. The draft bill's list of approved institutions included only maternity hospitals, but was extended to include other hospitals with intensive care units where the nearest maternity hospital did not have emergency medicine facilities.


The bill was drafted by the government and then introduced by it into the Oireachtas or parliament. After both Houses of the Oireachtas passed it, it was signed into law by the President.

In January 2013, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children held three days of discussions with interest groups on the government's plans. The meeting was held in the chamber of the Seanad (upper House), rather than a committee room, to allow more people to attend. Journalist Stephen Collins commented that it was an unusual and positive step to hold such a discussion before the drafting of a bill by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to Government. Health Minister James Reilly said in January 2014 that the process had "become now the standard for many bills".

The draft of the bill was published in April 2013. The official announcement stated that the provisions of the proposed legislation being published were strictly within the parameters of the X case. In May 2013, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children held three days of discussions on the draft bill with healthcare and legal professionals. Its report was laid before the Dáil on 30 May.

The bill was introduced in Dáil Éireann, the lower House of the Oireachtas, on 16 June 2013. It was the subject of vigorous debate. From the government parties, TDs Terence Flanagan, Peter Mathews, Billy Timmins, and Brian Walsh were expelled from the Fine Gael parliamentary party on 2 July 2013 after voting against the bill's second stage in defiance of a party whip. Lucinda Creighton was likewise expelled on 11 July for voting against the bill's report stage; she was also forced to resign as Minister of State for European Affairs. Michael McNamara of Labour also voted against the bill, but the party later explained this had been a mistake. From the opposition parties, Peadar Tóibín was suspended by Sinn Féin for six months after voting no against the whip. While Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin favoured the bill, the party's TDs demanded a free vote, and 13 of 19 voted against. This contributed to media reports that Martin's continued leadership of the party was in doubt.

Six pro-choice technical group TDs voted against the bill: Clare Daly, Joan Collins, Richard Boyd Barrett, Mick Wallace, Joe Higgins and Luke 'Ming' Flanagan. They argued instead for a referendum to repeal the 1983 Constitutional amendment which places the life of the mother and the unborn on an equal footing. Boyd Barrett criticised the exclusion of fatal foetal abnormality in the bill, which he said “will force women whose pregnancies will inevitably end in tragedy to go full term or travel overseas for terminations".

At the bill's report stage, 165 amendments were proposed. Faced with such a large number, the government decided to let the debate run over the originally allocated time, rather than using a guillotine motion to curtail it. Such a motion might have prevented discussion of the bill's most contentious sections, thereby increasing controversy. The report stage began at 11.50am on 10 July, and was adjourned at 5am the following morning.

At about 2.40am, as deputies were awaiting a division, Tom Barry pulled Áine Collins, a fellow Fine Gael TD for Cork East, onto his lap. Barry apologised publicly and was reprimanded by Fine Gael. He admitted having drunk alcohol before the incident but denied being drunk. Some politicians called for an end to the practice of the Oireachtas members' private bar remaining open and serving alcohol whenever Oireachtas business is being conducted.

Debate resumed at 5pm that evening, and concluded with the final vote at 12.25am on the morning of 12 July. The bill was finally approved by 127 votes to 31.

Six days were set aside for the bill's passage through the Seanad. It was introduced on Monday 15 July 2013 and passed its second stage the next day by 41 votes to 15. The No voters were: 10 of the 14 Fianna Fáil senators; independents Feargal Quinn and Rónán Mullen; Taoiseach's nominee Mary Ann O'Brien; and Fidelma Healy Eames and Paul Bradford, who lost the Fine Gael whip. Jim Walsh quoted an anti-abortion pamphlet's description of dilation and evacuation, which the bill's supporters criticised as inappropriate. Fianna Fáil's Brian Ó Domhnaill claimed that allowing abortions in the case of foetal anomalies would deprive Ireland of future Special Olympics athletes. He also remarked that Down Syndrome babies could be "left to die on sterilised trays". The bill passed its final stage unamended on 23 July 2013, by 39 votes to 14. If the Seanad had rejected or amended the bill, the Dáil would have had to be recalled from its summer recess to consider the Seanad's changes.

A bill passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas is sent to the President of Ireland to be signed into law. There were suggestions that the Seanad might petition President Michael D. Higgins to call an ordinary referendum on the bill.

Paschal Donohoe suggested Higgins might refer the bill to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution, to test whether it is constitutional. The President is required to summon a meeting of the Council of State before any referral, and on 24 July he called such a meeting for 29 July. Of the 24 members of the Council, 21 attended. Of the three absentees, Mary Robinson and John Bruton both made written submissions; the third, Albert Reynolds, had Alzheimer's disease. A bill allowed by the Supreme Court under Article 26 can never subsequently have its constitutionality challenged in court. News reports suggested that, for this reason, most members of the Council advised the President not to refer the bill, to allow the Supreme Court to consider it in the light of specific future cases rather than abstract hypothetical cases. Higgins had until 31 July 2013 to either sign or refer the bill; in the event, he signed it on 30 July without referral.

The bill has been criticised by commentators on both sides of the Irish abortion debate, both for being too restrictive, and for not being restrictive enough.

Jurist Gerry Whyte listed and critiqued five hypothetical grounds on which the Act might be argued to be unconstitutional: the lack of explicit time limits; the lack of an opt-out for institutions (as opposed to individuals) with conscience objections; the fact that a refused abortion can be appealed but an allowed abortion cannot; the lack of allowance for fatal fetal abnormality; and the possibility that the X-case judgment is not binding with regard to allowing suicide as grounds.

The Irish Catholic Bishops' Conference wrote a series of pastoral letters condemning the bill. In May 2013, Fine Gael TD Tom Barry wrote to Cardinal Seán Brady and the nuncio, Charles John Brown, asking whether TDs would be excommunicated if they voted for the bill. Derek Keating's parish priest stopped him serving as minister of the Eucharist after he voted for the Act.

Pro-Life commentators criticised the bill's lack of time limits. Breda O'Brien suggested doctors might induce labour of a borderline-viable fetus, resulting in permanent health problems associated with premature birth. Rónán Mullen suggested the prospect of medical malpractice lawsuits from such births might make doctors prefer late-term abortion instead.

While the bill was still in progress, the Department of Health published drafts of the Statutory Instruments for regulations to be introduced by the Minister for Health. Separate regulations deal with certification of appropriate institutions, reporting of procedures performed, and application for review of refused termination.

In August 2013, Kevin Doran, a priest on the board of governors of Mater Misericordiae University Hospital told "The Irish Times" it could not comply with the Act because of its Catholic ethos, while a hospital spokesperson said it had not yet formulated a policy on the Act. "The Irish Times" suggested that opting out was permissible, due to the deletion from the bill of an explicit requirement for approved institutions to facilitate terminations. The board held a four-hour meeting on 17 September, and announced on 24 September that it would comply with the act. Doran resigned from the board, while a nun on the board said the hospital "would not be performing abortions" and expressed uncertainty about future decisions. A spokesperson for St. Vincent's University Hospital, which has Religious Sisters of Charity management, said in August it would "be following the law of the land". The other approved hospitals are managed by the HSE, and so will provide facilities as a matter of course.

"The Irish Times" reported on 23 August 2013 that the first abortion under the terms of the Act had been performed several weeks earlier at the NMH. In fact, although the act had been passed, it had not commenced. The NMH story was investigated for possible breach of information privacy law. On 31 August, "The Irish Times" withdrew its story and stated "the case described in the article did not happen".

The Department of Health stated that commencement of the Act would not occur until the finalisation of the regulations required to implement its provisions. The Department established an expert committee comprising twelve people, including ten medical specialists. It first met on 24 September 2013 and was originally expected to report within three months. One task was appointing doctors to the review and appeals panels required by the Act, which was accomplished by December. On 19 December 2013, Minister Reilly signed several statutory instruments: those specifying regulations for certification, review, and notification of decisions, and a commencement order specifying 1 January 2014 as the date the Act and regulations would come into force.

Separate from the administrative regulations are the clinical guidelines for physicians to determine whether a given case meets the legal criteria specified by the Act. These were not in place when the Act commenced. There was criticism of the decision to commence the Act and regulations before the guidelines have been established. The College of Psychiatrists advised members not to participate in assessments for risk of loss of life from suicide until the guidelines had been published. "The Irish Times" reported in January 2014 that the guidelines were being drafted by the Medical Council; on 3 July 2014 it reported that they had been drawn up by the Department of Health and circulated to healthcare professionals. In August 2014 media reported on "Ms Y", who in July had a Caesarean section after 24 weeks' gestation, despite having requested an abortion and being suicidal. A revised version of the June guidelines was published on 19 September 2014. "The Irish Times" commented that the guidelines differed from those circulated in July, and "appear to go further than the Act in prescribing C-section and early induction"; Minister for Health Leo Varadkar denied the "Ms Y" case had influenced them.

The government on 29 October 2014 made a submission to the Council of Europe on its response to the "A, B and C v Ireland" judgment, summarizing the Act and ensuing regulations and publicity, and stating that the Health Service Executive would be producing a patient information leaflet for women. On 4 December 2014, the Council's Committee of Ministers closed the case as resolved. In February 2015, Clare Daly's private member's bill, to amend the 2013 act to allow abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormality, was rejected in the Dáil; the government argued that the bill was unconstitutional, which Daly disputed.

The first annual report on the act's operation was laid before the Dáil on 29 June 2015 by the Minister for Health. The report revealed that in 2014 there had been 26 terminations in the state under the act's provisions, of which three were on grounds of risk of suicide.

Lodewijk Bruckman

Lodewijk Karel "Loki" Bruckman (; 14 August 1903 – 24 April 1995) was a Dutch magic realist painter. He lived and worked in the Netherlands, the United States, and Mexico. Museum de Oude Wolden in the village of Bellingwolde has a permanent exhibition of his paintings.

Lodewijk Karel Bruckman was born on 14 August 1903 in The Hague in the Netherlands. He was the son of house painter Karel Lodewijk Bruckman (1868–1952) and Wilhelmina Frederika Hamel (1869–1930). He had two sisters and two brothers, one of whom was his twin brother Karel Lodewijk Bruckman (1903–1982).

Bruckman studied with his twin brother at the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague, where he was a student of Henk Meijer. He worked first as a set painter, later as a drawing teacher, and eventually as a fine artist.

In 1949, Bruckman and his life partner Evert Zeeven, who was also his manager, moved to the United States. They lived in New York City and Provincetown in the U.S. and also in Morelia in Mexico. Bruckman had several gallery exhibitions in New York.

In 1968, they returned to the Netherlands, where they lived in Wemeldinge, Haarlem, and Bellingwedde. Bruckman stopped oil painting in 1986, but continued with pencil drawing. In 1989, they moved to Leeuwarden. Zeeven died on 30 November 1993. One and a half year later, Bruckman died on 24 April 1995 in Leeuwarden, at the age of 91.

Bruckman painted figuratively, forest views, and other still lifes with fruit, flowers, shells, eggs, feathers and towels. His style can be described as realistic, surrealistic or magic realistic. In 1958, Frank Crotty described Bruckman's painting with the following words:
Bruckman gained popularity in the United States, while he remained relatively unknown in the Netherlands. His painting "Composition With Peaches" won the popular vote at the Boston Arts Festival in 1953 and he became second in 1957. He won the J. Porter Brinton Prize in 1954. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City has a still life called "Mobile" (1955) by Bruckman in its collection and the Cape Cod Museum of Art in Dennis a painting named "Rancho Style" (1960).

In the 1980s, Bruckman donated fifteen paintings to the municipality of Goes and 21 paintings, with an estimated value of 363,000 euro, to the municipality of Bellingwedde.

Capture of Fricourt

Fricourt is a village that was fought over during the Battle of the Somme, which took place in France during the First World War in July 1916. Fricourt is from Albert, north of Bray and west of Mametz, near the D 938 road and at the junction of the D 147 with the D 64. The village is north-east of Amiens and on the route of the Albert–Péronne light railway. Fricourt Wood was north-east of the village, with a château on the edge of the village and a number of craters, known as the Tambour ( to the Germans) on the west side. Fricourt formed a salient in the German front-line and was the principal German fortified village between the River Somme and the Ancre. 

The ground sloped south-west from Bazentin ridge, divided by Willow Stream, which rose in Trônes Wood and flowed past the ends of the Mametz and Fricourt spurs. The stream was the inner boundary of the 7th Division on the right and the 21st Division on the left, of the XV Corps. German fortification of the area around Mametz and Fricourt had created a web of trenches deep behind the front-line trench, which was irregular, making many angles from which an attacker could be engaged.

On 24 June 1916, the artillery preparation began for the Anglo-French offensive; the Fricourt area was subjected to several British gas attacks during the bombardment. Several mines were detonated just before on 1 July, when British infantry attack on the German defences either side of the village began. By the end of 1 July, the village had been enveloped on three sides and during the night, the German garrison withdrew towards the second position. British patrols reported the retirement overnight and at noon on 2 July, troops of the 17th Division occupied the village and captured Fricourt Wood in the mid-afternoon. 

The 28th ("Baden") Reserve Division, which held the front from Montauban to Fricourt and Ovillers, was saved from destruction by reinforcements from the 10th Bavarian Division. The 3rd Guard Division was hurried forward from Valenciennes, to hold the ground in front of the second position and British attacks began on Shelter and Bottom woods up the slope towards Contalmaison. XV Corps had more than on 1 July, of which the 10th Battalion West Yorkshire Regiment suffered the worst of the battalions engaged on the first day; XV Corps took 

The German army arrived at Fricourt on 29 September 1914, when the 26th ("Württemberg") Reserve Division and the 28th () Reserve Division of the XIV Reserve Corps, tried to continue an advance westwards towards Amiens. By 7 October, temporary scrapes had been occupied, after a night attack turned into a fiasco and soldiers were captured. Fighting in the area from the Somme north to the Ancre, subsided into minor line-straightening attacks by both sides. In December the French attacked all along the new Western Front, which around Fricourt from cost both sides thousands of casualties. In 1915 the war around the village went underground, with mining and counter-mining. In the village of La Boisselle, just north of Fricourt, were blown between April 1915 and January 1916. At the end of July 1915, fresh troops were observed moving into the French positions north of the Somme and were identified on 1 August, at Thiepval Wood as British soldiers ("dressed in brown suits").

In January 1915, Erich von Falkenhayn, the German Chief of the General Staff had issued instructions on defensive policy, which required the existing front line to be made capable of being easily defended by small numbers of troops. Positions lost in the front line were to be recaptured by counter-attack and a second trench was to be built behind the front trench, to shelter the front garrison during bombardments. To evade shell-fire on the area behind the front line, communication trenches were to be dug, through which the troops in the second trench could move forward. Behind the front position, a new position was to be dug beyond enemy field-artillery range, to hold up an attack which had broken through the first line, while a counter-attack was mounted. A new line could be formed and linked to the occupied flanks of the first position, restricting an attacker to a bend in the line, rather than a breakthrough if counter-attacks failed. Construction of these defences took much of 1915 and since the front line was to be held at all costs, the forward position was completed first. On 6 May, another defensive position was ordered to be built behind the front line.

In July 1915 the French Commander in Chief Joseph Joffre held the first inter-Allied conference at Chantilly and in December 1915, a second conference resolved to conduct simultaneous attacks by the French, Russian, British and Italian armies. For the British, Flanders was the main theatre of operations but in February 1916, Haig accepted Joffre's plan for a combined attack astride the Somme river to begin around 1 July. In April the British Cabinet accepted the necessity of an offensive in France. The nature of a joint offensive on the Somme began to change almost immediately, when the German army began the Verdun offensive on 21 February. In March Foch had proposed an offensive on a front between Lassigny and the Somme and a British attack on a front from the Somme to Thiepval, with and divisions. French divisions intended for the joint offensive were diverted to Verdun and the offensive was eventually reduced to a main effort by the British, with a supporting attack by one French army. British planning for the offensive began in April, with a Fourth Army proposal for a methodical advance to the high ground around Thiepval and thence to the Bapaume–Péronne road. Haig rejected the concept and required the British objective on the Somme to be the capture of the ridge north of Péronne, to assist the French cross the Somme further south. Diversion of French divisions to Verdun and the assumption by the British of the main role in the Somme offensive, led to revisions of the plan towards a more ambitious attempt at strategic attrition, by a breakthrough and a battle of manoeuvre, with distant objectives.

Around Fricourt the original temporary German scrapes and trenches were elaborated, according to Falkenhayn's instructions, with concrete used to give shell-proof protection. Lines of trenches were dug to link the village fortifications and improved by second and third trenches behind the front line, creating a first position. The barbed wire entanglement was doubled to two belts about apart. The front line had two support trenches further back, the to accommodate the front garrison and the third for local reserves. Dug-outs had been deepened to and an intermediate line of strong points, the was built further back. The second (reserve) line had been built beyond field artillery range and the building of a third line, another further back had begun in February 1916. In the first half of 1916, as signs of an Anglo-French offensive on the Somme multiplied, more defensive works were built all over the Somme front and raiding was increased to snatch prisoners for questioning. In late May 1916, a spoiling attack was planned from Foucaucourt on the south bank of the Somme, north to St Pierre Divion, intended to reach a depth of . An attack was made impossible on 4 June, when the forces to carry it out were sent to Russia to counter the Brusilov Offensive.

The British method of attack by 1916, was to fire an intense bombardment on the German front trenches just before zero hour, then lift the bombardment to the next trench, then the next according to a timetable. Before the barrage lifted, infantry were to creep as close as possible to the bombardment, considered to be from the trench and to attack as soon as the shell-fire lifted. The destructive effect of the bombardment was said by Haig and Rawlinson, to be such that nothing could live in the target area and that infantry would only have to occupy the ground. It was recommended that the infantry should attack from trenches no further than from the German front line. The digging of such trenches was opposed by some divisional commanders, lest it alerted the defenders and the decision was delegated to corps and divisional commanders. Some divisions dug advanced trenches but most expected to begin the advance across no man's land covered by the barrage. In the XV Corps area, both divisions were to attack behind a creeping barrage and begin the advance from various points, some from support trenches behind the British front line, due damage caused by German artillery-fire and mining and some from no man's land, after crawling forward just before the end of the bombardment.

XV Corps was commanded by Lieutenant-General Horne, with the 7th, 21st and 17th divisions, five artillery groups and a siege battery, on a front of , about one heavy gun every and one field gun per . The infantry attack was to be made behind a creeping barrage, in which the would slowly move their fire beyond the German front trench, at intervals, as the heavy artillery lifted from objective to objective, when the creeping barrage reached it. If infantry caught up with the creeping barrage, they were to take cover and attack when the barrage moved forward. Air co-operation for XV Corps was to come from 3 Squadron and 9 Squadron Royal Flying Corps (RFC).

In the first stage of the Corps plan, the divisions were to occupy higher ground either side of Willow Stream and beyond Mametz on the right, then take Fricourt in the next stage, moving through the first German intermediate position, to the second intermediate position across the valley fronting Mametz Wood. The right was to gain contact with the XIII Corps at White Trench and the left link with III Corps, at Quadrangle Trench below Contalmaison. The final objective was chosen to receive a counter-attack, with good artillery observation in front of dead ground, from which the artillery could bombard the German second position. If the German defence collapsed, the 17th Division in corps reserve, would pass through and advance beyond Mametz Wood, up the north side of Caterpillar Valley, to Bazentin le Grand, Longueval and Ginchy. Fricourt was not to be attacked frontally but isolated, for which the right hand brigade of the 7th Division was to take Mametz and then White Trench, the centre brigade was to form a defensive flank on the south rise of Willow Valley, which faced Fricourt and Fricourt Wood to the north. The inner brigades of the 7th Division and 21st Division were to wait in the front-line trenches opposite the village, until ordered forward by the corps commander. 

At an intensive bombardment was to begin and from gas was to be released at the centre of the front opposite Fricourt, at a hurricane bombardment from Stokes mortars was to begin and at a smoke-screen would be generated, to screen the inner flanks of the 7th and 21st divisions and cloud the German support line opposite the 7th Division. As part of the Mines on the first day of the Somme, three mines of , and were to be blown at under the Tambour, to create crater lips to protect the 21st Division infantry from machine-guns at German Tambour. Bulgar Point near Mametz was mined with a charge, a sap further west mined with a charge and four mines were planted south of Hidden Wood.

The 28th Reserve Division faced XV Corps with the I and III Battalions, Reserve Infantry Regiment 109, which had in shell-hole positions and the II Battalion in reserve opposite the British 7th Division. The regiment was due for relief on the night of but the extent of British artillery-fire kept Infantry Regiment 23 back near Montauban. Deep dug-outs had been built in the front line but few had been dug further back, which led to the trench garrison being crowded in the first trench. The divisional artillery, an essential part of the defence plan, was smashed up by British artillery-fire. Reserve Infantry Regiment 111 held the sector opposite the British 21st Division.

The right and centre brigades of the division attacked on a 
front from the Carnoy–Mametz track, to a quarry near Hidden Wood. The 20th Brigade in the centre was to wheel left to form a line, from the north-west corner of Mametz to the south-west along Orchard Alley, across the Maricourt road, with the left near Bois Français, linking with the 22nd Brigade, which waited for the order to advance. The right-hand battalion of the 20th Brigade advanced from an area behind the front line, due to damage in the front line trenches and was devastated in no man's land, by machine-gun fire from Fricourt Wood and the German support trench. The bombardment of Fricourt failed due to the howitzer shell fuzes falling out, before the shells reached the target. The survivors pressed on and entered the front trench south of Fricourt and some parties reached the support trench, further on and overpowered the German troops in adjacent communication trenches. 

Advancing further was impossible but the battalion continued to snipe and bomb the Germans opposite, as the flanking battalions advanced. Reinforcements later in the morning were also caught by machine-gun fire in no man's land and the survivors were unable to make progress beyond the existing 20th Brigade position. The left-hand battalion crossed no man's land with far fewer casualties and wheeled left to Hidden Lane, beyond Hidden Wood and short of Apple Alley up the slope. Small parties mopped up German troops among the craters and mine shafts in the area, taking Hidden Lane by despite losses from German troops in Mametz and Hidden Wood. The wood was captured by a frontal attack, combined with bombers moving down Hidden Lane, before parties advanced to the objective at Apple Alley. Establishment of the defensive flank towards Fricourt was not possible but the 22nd Brigade managed to occupy the German front and support trenches near the village and gain touch with the 20th brigade.

The division attacked with the 50th Brigade (attached from the 17th Division) on the right and the 63rd and 64th brigades to the left, with the 62nd Brigade in reserve. The 50th Brigade was to be ready to attack Fricourt, if the enveloping attacks on the flanks failed, except for the left-hand battalion, which was to attack to form a defensive flank facing the village. The 21st Division brigades were to advance to the first objective at Crucifix Trench, the German intermediate line and then continue to the second objective at Bottom Wood and Quadrangle Trench, in the second German intermediate line, to link with troops from the 7th Division. The 10th Battalion, West Yorkshire Regiment, attacked on a front of and the first two companies reached the German front trench with few casualties, then pressed on to Red Cottage at the north end of Fricourt. The rest of the battalion was caught by machine-guns in the village and German Tambour, which had survived the mine explosions and were forward of the creeping barrage. The two companies were practically annihilated and only a few troops reached the front trench. The companies at Red Cottage were overrun later in the morning, only a few groups managing to reach the 63rd Brigade to the north. The companies in no man's land were pinned down until dark and the battalion lost , the worst battalion loss of the First Day. 

The two 21st Division brigades had to move up the west slope of the Fricourt spur, then advance across the dip and the first Fricourt–Contalmaison road to the first objective at Crucifix Trench, on the east slope of Fricourt spur. The right flank was to advance to Fricourt Farm and the left to Round Wood, south of Scots Redoubt. The two leading battalions of the 63rd Brigade had many casualties in no man's land; half of the right-hand battalion advanced five minutes before zero hour, to crawl across no man's land but were forced back by machine-gun fire. The survivors formed one line to advance again at zero and were swept by fire from six machine-guns, before reaching the German support trench; forty survivors then followed the barrage to the Sunken Road. The two support companies were also caught in no man's land and only reached the front trench, where the troops consolidated and defeated three counter-attacks from Fricourt. The left-hand battalion also tried to creep into no man's land and was fired on but continued to advance and the survivors reached the front trench, preceded by a shower of grenades and bombed forward to the support trench.

The supporting battalions were to advance at to pass through to the second objective, when the creeping barrage moved on but the German opposition to the leading battalions, led to the supporting battalions being sent to reinforce the first objective at Despite machine-gun fire sweeping no man's land, the survivors reached the top of Fricourt spur, on the right reaching the Sunken Road where a standing barrage was falling, before being stopped by machine-gun fire from Fricourt and the wood on the right. The left battalion reached the leading troops and bombed along communication trenches, occupying Lozenge Alley up to the Sunken Road to secure their right flank. Other parties advanced up the road to Crucifix Trench and more probed towards Fricourt Farm before retiring. German bombers counter-attacked towards Sunken Road but were repulsed and the British built a strong point in Lonely Trench. Royal Engineers intended to build more posts, were pressed into service as infantry instead, to hold the right flank of the brigade.
The 64th Brigade front had a small salient at each end, between which a Russian sap had secretly been dug. The sap was exposed just before the attack, so that the British troops could attack in a straight line, from the far side of the wire. During the intense bombardment in the last five minutes before zero hour, companies of the two leading battalions crept forward from the sap, as German machine-gunners ignored the bombardment, to set up their guns on the parapet and machine-gunners on higher ground near La Boisselle, swept no man's land and the ground behind the German front trench. When the hurricane bombardment stopped the battalions stood up and advanced through the German wire, despite many casualties and took the trench as German troops showered them with stick-grenades. The two supporting battalions followed close behind and all four rushed the German support trench and took in ten minutes, half of both leading battalions becoming casualties. The advance continued when the creeping barrage moved on, across the top of the spur towards Sunken Road, as German parties and the leading troops engaged with bombs and bayonets. 

The Sunken Road was reached at after crossing of open ground. A halt was called but some troops pressed on to Crucifix Trench and took from Shelter Wood prisoner. Fire from Fricourt Wood, Shelter Wood and Birch Tree Wood, made an advance to the second objective impractical as the creeping barrage had moved on. The brigade commander went forward and placed troops on the open left flank, where the 34th Division of III Corps was to have reached. More troops were sent forward to Crucifix Trench and Lewis-gunners sent to Lozenge Wood to the south. Brigadier-General Headlam led an attack on Round Wood to the north but most of the attackers were hit by machine-gun fire from the wood. A post was formed at the junction of Crucifix Trench and the Sunken Road and the wood was occupied at when the garrison left the wood to counter-attack troops from the 34th Division, who had lost direction and approached the wood from the west. The existing positions were consolidated and Headlam returned to divisional headquarters by and obtained two battalions from the reserve brigade. The reinforcements struggled through congested trenches and eventually took over the right of the 63rd Brigade and left of the 64th Brigade.

At midday XV Corps headquarters had gained an exaggerated view of the success of the offensive, XIII Corps on the right had reported that the Germans were in full retreat to Bazentin le Grand and III Corps had announced that its troops were advancing towards Contalmaison. Air observers reported that German artillery was withdrawing along the Albert–Bapaume road and that British infantry had been seen between Fricourt and Contalmaison. Air observers also saw flares lit by British troops below, which were reported promptly. On the right of XV Corps Kite Balloon Section, was able to order a bombardment on a party of Germans who had counter-attacked Danzig Alley, which was so effective that a renewed British attack took it easily. Horne ordered the third phase to commence, unaware that not all of the first phase objectives had been reached and set zero hour for after a thirty-minute bombardment. The 22nd Brigade of the 7th Division waiting south of Fricourt, attacked with battalions and the leading companies got across no man's land with few losses. The support companies were caught by machine-gun fire from the left, the detachments having been intended to bomb down communication trenches to Willow Valley and Fricourt, being nearly annihilated. A small party reached the Rectangle, was bombed back to the support trench and all attempts to press forward again were met with more machine-gun fire from the left; an attempt to bomb forward along trenches also failed. The left-hand battalion bombed up Sunken Road Trench and both sides of the Rectangle to Apple Alley and briefly gained a foothold in Fricourt, which distracted the German defenders on the right, where touch was also gained with the 20th Brigade troops in Apple Alley. 

The 50th Brigade attacked north of the Willow Stream, the plan being changed after the 10th West Yorkshires were destroyed in the morning. The right-hand battalion attacked at after protesting that the attack would fail unless the objective attacked earlier by the 10th West Yorkshires was taken first. The second stage was ordered despite the failure of the first stage, against the most fortified part of the Fricourt defences, between Wing Corner below the southern tip of the village and German Tambour in front of the western face. The preliminary bombardment failed to cut the wire, due to faulty fuzes and only small gaps were made, German dug-outs in the area were left untouched. The battalion was engaged from both flanks as soon as it advanced, despite covering fire from Lewis guns on the railway embankment nearby. In three minutes had been inflicted, some German troops standing on the parapet to fire. A small number of British troops reached the village and were overrun and killed or captured, except for one party which occupied a cellar. The survivors in no man's land were pinned down until dark and a support battalion which followed the advance was also cut down in no man's land; the 50th Brigade attack was suspended.
As the third phase attack by the centre brigades collapsed, the outer brigades of both divisions consolidated their hold on Mametz and Fricourt spurs. On the 7th Division front, the last company of the right-hand battalion of the 20th Brigade, advanced at and despite being caught by machine-gun fire from the Shrine, arrived in time to exploit the attack on Fricourt at The 20th Brigade was reinforced by part of a supporting battalion, to attack through Mametz towards Bunny Trench, past troops who had already worked forward into the east end of the village. Four lines advanced at after a bombardment. As they approached the village, about troops emerged from dugouts at the Shrine and Mametz to surrender and by the village was captured, after a last stand by the garrison. The troops reached Bunny Trench, to complete the first phase of the 20th Brigade plan. From the centre of the divisional front facing Fricourt, the line ran from the north-west corner of Mametz, left to the slope along Orchard Alley, across the Péronne road and light railway, along Apple Alley to the Maricourt spur, joining the right of the 22nd Brigade in the German first and support lines.

On the 21st Division front, little ground was gained during the afternoon but a defensive flank was established against Fricourt. The 63rd and 64th brigades had been ordered to exploit the attack on the village at to advance from the Sunken Road and Crucifix Trench, to Fricourt Farm and Shelter Wood, the 63rd Brigade to be ready to intercept a retreat from Fricourt. On the brigade front, attempted movement was met with machine-gun fire from Fricourt Farm and the north side of Fricourt Wood. An attack by the 64th Brigade was carried out in a rush, when the order arrived ten minutes after the bombardment on Shelter Wood had lifted and the attack from Crucifix Trench by parts of two battalions failed. At the divisional commander Major-General Campbell, ordered both brigades to consolidate the line running from Willow Stream in the British front line, to opposite German Tambour, the German front trench on the left of the 50th Brigade; the 63rd Brigade to consolidate along Lonely Lane, Lozenge Alley and Lozenge Wood facing Fricourt. 

To the north the 64th Brigade held a line from Lozenge Wood, the first intermediate line, Crucifix Trench to Round Wood where touch had been gained with the 34th Division. At Campbell ordered the last two battalions of the 62nd Brigade forward, to relieve the 64th Brigade at dawn on 2 July. At the 17th Division was ordered to take over from the 21st Division facing Fricourt, the 50th Brigade being relieved by the 51st Brigade, ready for another attack in the morning, as observers and patrols had reported retirements by the Germans in the area of Fricourt. An opportunity to attack when the German defence was still disorganised, was lost when the arrival of the 51st Brigade was held up by congestion behind the British front line until Very little German firing took place on the 21st Division front overnight, many wounded were recovered and supplies were brought up without interference, although there was an acute water shortage in the captured area.

At Rawlinson ordered the offensive to continue, in the XV Corps area to take Fricourt, advance to the final objective and to link with III Corps south of Contalmaison. The front around Fricourt remained quiet during the night and a German counter-attack further south at Maricourt was repulsed. Horne ordered an attack on Fricourt at on 2 July, after a bombardment, the 17th Division to link with the 7th Division north of Mametz. Soon afterwards a 7th Division patrol reported that Fricourt had been entered unopposed at midnight. A patrol from the 51st Brigade took from Reserve Infantry Regiment 111 and Major-General Pilcher ordered the brigade to enter the village immediately. In the confusion the village was not occupied until noon on 2 July, where eleven German stragglers were captured. The attack continued behind a creeping barrage with Bottom Wood as the final objective. The advance moved through Fricourt Wood where fallen trees, thick undergrowth and German machine-gun fire slowed progress. By nightfall touch had been gained with the 7th Division on the right and along the north and north-eastern fringes of Fricourt Wood and Fricourt Farm, at the junction with the 21st Division. Observers in aircraft on contact patrol, followed the attack and reported the fall of the farm minutes afterwards. Railway Alley was relatively undamaged but bombers attacked from the west and took just before midnight.

The preliminary bombardment was particularly effective on the front of the 28th Reserve Division and was more destructive on 1 July, when the artillery batteries in the valleys near Montauban and Mametz were destroyed along with their ammunition, few of the guns being withdrawn to the second position. All the field guns of the 28th Reserve Division were put out of action and reports described the bombardment as (devastating). Much of the garrison was in the front line where most of the dug-outs had been built. Telephone communication was cut and machine-guns in Danzig Alley north of Mametz, were destroyed or made inoperable. Scattered resistance in Mametz continued at and the last survivors retired at As soon as the attack began two battalions of Infantry Regiment 23 and every available man from Reserve Infantry Regiment 109, were sent to the second position. Reinforcements were not sent forward to the front line, due to uncertainty about the fighting at Montauban. 

Opposite the 21st Division, Reserve Infantry Regiment 111 had many casualties in the bombardment and most trenches, obstacles, shallow dug-outs and observation posts were destroyed, although a few dug-out entrances were kept clear. On Fricourt spur the situation was worse and the northernmost company of Reserve Infantry Regiment 110 was reduced to Mine explosions west of Fricourt at the (Tambour) caused much destruction and the 8th Company of Reserve Infantry Regiment 110 left a machine-gun crew behind, withdrew and was replaced by the 2nd Company, which was outflanked, attacked from behind and all the personnel killed or captured. A replacement company failed to reach the area but took cover in Round Wood, where it repulsed the first 64th Brigade attack. By evening the survivors withdrew towards the (Shoelace Maker's Cave) an elaborate dug-out near Fricourt Wood.

Machine-guns in the second position failed to work and local counter-attacks were not able to retrieve the situation, as the British advance around Mametz outflanked the garrison in Fricourt, where the defence was hampered by fog, gas and smoke. A British attack west of the Tambour was countered by a defensive mine, which inflicted many casualties on the 21st Division as it attacked along with machine-gun fire from the hill above Fricourt. In the area of Reserve Infantry Regiment 109, the attack began with the sound of the mine explosions on the right flank; the effect of the British bombardment had already been sufficient to require the relief of two companies, due on the evening of 1 July from Infantry Regiment 23. The damage caused by the bombardment, the narrowness of no man's land and the surprise of the Russian sap, allowed the British to break in while most of the garrison was under cover. An instant counter-attack failed and the defence was pushed back within minutes, one company being back in the third trench by 

On the left flank, the III Battalion was also pushed back, despite attempts by the II Battalion to reinforce the defence. The defeat of the 12th Division around Montauban had uncovered the southern flank and during the afternoon, constant attacks gradually wore down the defence. At the headquarters of the III Battalion was captured and by the rallied at the second position at Bazentin le Petit. During the night, orders from Below arrived for the garrison of Fricourt to withdraw, which was accomplished relatively easily, as the British attack had stopped. Reinforcements from III Battalion, Reserve Infantry Regiment 186 were sent to the area of Reserve Infantry Regiment 111 in the evening of 2 July and were all killed or captured along with the remnants of Reserve Infantry Regiment 111, as the British advanced from Fricourt and Mametz towards Mametz Wood.

The XV Corps attack took a considerable amount of ground on the flanks, the right advancing and the left ; in the centre the attack failed and although enveloped on three sides Fricourt was not captured. In Prior and Wilson's account, the salient around Fricourt made the village inherently vulnerable to artillery-fire in enfilade. The failure to engage in counter-battery fire by XV Corps, was redeemed by the emphasis on it by XIII Corps artillery to the south and the French guns of XX Corps, which wiped out the German artillery near Fricourt. The density of the destructive bombardment was much greater than elsewhere and a lack of deep dug-outs, led to most of the defenders congregating in dug-outs under the front trench, which reduced the capacity of the surviving German infantry to withstand the attack. Prior and Wilson described the failure of the tactical ploy of infantry moving into no man's land before zero hour and the catastrophe of the 50th Brigade attack in the afternoon, after XV Corps received inaccurate reports from XIII and III Corps.

C. T. Atkinson the 7th Division historian, wrote that the success of the 30th, 18th and 7th divisions partly made up for the failures further north and that with the ground gained by the 21st Division, the plan to envelop Fricourt and link the inner flanks of the divisions was completed on 2 July. The infantry advance took four minutes to reach the empty British front line, which had been bombarded by German artillery during the intense fire in the hour before zero and were taken in Mametz. The afternoon attack of the 20th Brigade achieved an advance sufficient to guard the left flank of the division and during the day, the 7th divisional artillery fired of field gun ammunition and In the early morning, orders for a resumption of attacks to the final objective were issued, as patrols found Fricourt undefended, took a number of prisoners and met troops of the 17th Division in Willow Trench, taking many prisoners.

Most of the XV Corps casualties were inflicted by machine-gun fire, the 7th Division losing , the 21st Division having and the 50th Brigade, 17th Division The 10th Battalion West Yorkshire Regiment had the greatest number of casualties of any battalion engaged on the first day. were taken and Reserve Infantry Regiment 109 had not all incurred on the XV Corps front.

The advances achieved by the British south of the Albert–Bapaume road continued after 1 July, with the occupation of Fricourt on 2 July and an advance across Caterpillar Valley, where the ground rose in , with more artillery being concentrated on a narrower front and shallower objectives being set. Operations were intended to close on the German second line and threaten the rear of the German defences from Ovillers to Thiepval, ready for another general attack from Longueval to Bazentin le Petit, which required the capture of the intermediate German defences in front of Mametz Wood and Contalmaison. Some of the survivors of the defence of Fricourt and reinforcements which began to arrive on 2 July, took over the intermediate line from Mametz Wood to La Boisselle. Late on 2 July XV Corps ordered an attack by the 17th and 21st divisions to begin at on 3 July, to capture Shelter and Bottom woods south of Contalmaison as the 7th Division attacked towards Mametz Wood.

Fricourt was recaptured by German troops on 26 March 1918, during the retreat of the 17th Division and the 1st Dismounted Brigade of the 1st Cavalry Division during Operation Michael, the German spring offensive. The 17th Division minus the 50th Brigade collected round Fricourt. German troops assumed that the British were being routed attacked the 51st Brigade, which had been reduced to about frontally and incurred losses which were considered to be the worst in the March battles. During the afternoon the village was captured and Cubbon's Composite Brigade, assembled from rear area personnel and stragglers, filled the gap between Fricourt Wood and the dismounted cavalry by The 52nd Brigade occupied Fricourt and managed to stop the German advance but on 26 March a general retirement of the V Corps divisions was ordered and the viialge was evacuated at In the afternoon, air reconnaissance saw that the British defence of the line from Montauban and Ervillers was collapsing and the RFC squadrons in the area, made a maximum effort to disrupt the German advance. The village was recaptured for the last time on 25 August, by the 18th Division, during the Second Battle of Bapaume.

Tamil Nadu Vanniyar Public Properties Welfare Board

The Tamil Nadu Government established the Vanniyar Public Properties Welfare Board to identify Vanniyar Charitable Trusts created by Vanniyar philanthropists, consolidate those trusts, research ways to ensure the fulfillment of the objects of the Trusts, and confirm that the benefits reached the intended sections of the Vanniyar community.

People belonging to the Vanniyakula Kshatriya community live in various parts of Tamil Nadu. A number of philanthropists belonging to this community have dedicated their properties for various charitable purposes by creating trusts/endowments for humanitarian purposes, such as choultries for feeding the poor, institutions for the advancement of education, medical relief and public health and other similar objects.

Properties endowed in the past by philanthropists for various charitable purposes have not been carefully maintained, and several properties have either been improperly sold or left to be encroached on, while the charities were not performed, and thus the testators’ wishes remained unfulfilled.

People interested in the preservation, protection and maintenance of various such trusts/endowments asked the Government to constitute a separate board to consolidate such trusts/endowments, preserve the properties of the trusts, and fulfill the wishes of the testators by providing them with good administration, so the trusts/endowments could carry out the objects for which they were created without hindrance.

After due consideration, the Government constituted a board under G.O. (Ms.) No. 20, BC, MBC and Minority Welfare Department, dated 2.3.2009, to safeguard the property of such trusts/endowments for the benefit of the Vanniyakula Kshatriya community and the public at large. A Special Officer belonging to the Indian Administrative Service was appointed to establish a Vanniyar Public Properties Welfare Board and to identify such trusts/endowments, consolidate them and find out how to fulfill their objectives. He is assisted by a Legal Adviser, who is a retired District and Sessions Judge, a Tahsildar and supportive staff.

Auðunn rauði Þorbergsson

Auðunn rauði Þorbergsson (c. 1250–1322) was bishop of Iceland's northern diocese of Hólar 1313–22.

Auðunn was a Norwegian and was for a while a priest of Trondenes in Hålogaland (not far from Harstad in northern Norway). He later became a canon of Nidaros Cathedral, and became one of the foremost of their number, for example in their disputes with Archbishop Jǫrundr of Nidaros. Auðunn was well travelled and more than once visited the Pope in Rome. He won the esteem of the Norwegian king and was for a long time a retainer of Haakon V of Norway.

Auðunn was consecrated Bishop of Hólar on November 25, 1313. He arrived in Iceland in the summer of 1315 (at Seleyri í Borgarfirði) and rode north to Hólar. As bishop he exterd control firmly, both regarding finances and discipline among the clergy. He soon got into disputes with the major clerics of his diocese, events which are recounted particularly by "Laurentius saga". Major achievements during his episcopate were his translation of the relics of Bishop Guðmundur Arason, helping to establish his feast within the northern Church. In 1318 he had the "máldagar" (property records) of his diocese collected in a book, providing a major historical record of the diocese's (then) ninety-eight churches. He brought with him a timber building from Norway which was erected at Hólar in 1316–17, later called Auðunarstofa, which stood until 1810 and was reconstructed in 2002 under the guidance of the then suffragan bishop of Hólar, Bolli Gústavsson.

In the summer of 1320, Auðunn sailed to Norway, amongst other things to protect his interests in his dealing with the Icelaners, and died in Nidaros on January 28, 1322. He was buried at Church of St Mary in Trondheim. He was succeeded by Laurentius Kálfsson. Auðunn had at least one daughter, Ölöf, whose son Eysteinn rauði became a prominent cleric under the tutelage of his grandfather and Laurentius.

MBA Polymers was originally founded in 1994 in the United States by Mike Biddle. The company specializes in recycling durable goods from waste streams such as electronics and auto-shredder residue.MBA Polymers raised money to develop its technology for extracting and recycling plastic from many devices.

Raw material arrives at MBA Polymers’ recycling facilities either shredded or as whole parts, often from other recyclers that do not handle plastic.
MBA works with manufacturers around the world to replace virgin plastics with MBA plastics in their new products.

Having opened its first recycling facility in 1994, MBA Polymers also has recycling plants in the UK and in China, and has recently announced plans to relocate its research and development facilities from the United States to the United Kingdom.
In 2004 MBA Polymers created a joint venture with Guangzhou Iron and Steel Enterprises Holdings Ltd to establish its sustainable recycling operations in China. MBA Polyers' operations in China now employ over 160 people. The company has invested USD$15million in the recycling plant.

The company expanded its operations to Austria in 2006.

MBA has more than 300 million lb/year of processing capacity in Europe, China and the U.S. to turn waste into recycled plastics.

MBA Polymers Ltd is working with The Plastic Bank to develop initiatives to incentivise people around the world to recycle more plastic and improve the sustainability of the plastics industry.

The company experienced a factory fire in October 2000, which resulted in the death of one employee. This led to a one-year shutdown of operations. Investigations revealed that the fire was caused by dust from a toner cartridge; the company no longer accepts toner cartridges into its recycling facilities.

Helix figulina

Helix figulina is a species of air-breathing land snail, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Helicidae, the typical snails.

The shells of this species are dirty white to yellow-brownish in color, usually 21-27×20-26 mm in size. Large shells are about 29-31×29-30 mm.
This species is present in Greece, Bulgaria and the Republic of Macedonia, except, perhaps, the island of Skyros in the Aegean Sea, where only empty shells of the species have been found, suggesting a recent extinction in the area. There have been reports of the species in western Turkey, however, it seems that these are actually "Helix nucula", a related and similar species.

This land snail is found in a variety of habitats including dry, open, shrub-land areas. It ranges from coastal areas (dunes) up to 700 m above sea level. On the continent, it lives only in areas where there is enough soil, as it is a soil-dwelling species, and sometimes buries deep into the soil. In southwest Bulgaria it lives at altitudes of up to 700 m.

<doc id="39944232" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39944232" title="Bangladesh Anti Quota Protests 2013">
Bangladesh Anti Quota Protests 2013

The Bangladesh Anti Quota Protests of 2013 were protests against incumbent government policies regarding jobs in the government sector in the country. They began in the same location that saw the 2013 Shahbag protests in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Although initially confined to the locality of Shahbag and Dhaka University campus, they eventually spread to other parts of Bangladesh. The protests attained popularity as students of different universities in various parts of the country brought out processions of their own while demonstrating in solidarity with the main protest movement and pressing forward with similar demands.

Under the current BCS examinations system, 30 per cent of the seats are reserved for children of freedom fighters and 10 per cent for women. A further 10 per cent is reserved for districts, 5 per cent for national minorities and 1 per cent for people with disabilities. As a result, only 44 percent of the examinees are able to secure positions on the basis of merit, causing discontent among a large section of general students who say that they are deprived despite scoring higher than candidates who fall under any quota.

Protesters formed a 10-member committee known as ‘Medhamullayon Mancha’ and said Abdur Rahim, student of University of Dhaka would act as convener of the committee. They have called for the re-evaluation of results of the 34th BCS preliminary examination and the cancellation of quota system in all public examinations.

On Wednesday, 10 July 2013, hundreds of Bangladesh Civil Service examinees began protests demanding an immediate cancellation of all sorts of quota in public service recruitment. Several hundred job-seekers who did not pass the 34th BCS preliminary exam had gathered in the Shahbagh crossing, blocking the roads passing through, till 10:00 pm for more than 10 hours demanding the re-evaluation of answer scripts claiming that they had not been selected even after doing good in the exam and the cancellation of the quota system. The Bangladesh Public Service Commission later in the evening said that it would review the preliminary test results.

On Thursday, 11 July 2013, the students, who gathered at Shahbagh intersection for the 2nd day demanding cancellation of the quota system in recruitment to government jobs, were forced to leave the place as police charged baton and lobbed teargas shells on them. In a short time, the clashes spread throughout the Dhaka University campus area. Protesters alleged that ruling party Chhatra League activists joined the police in attacking protesters on the Dhaka University campus and beat them up with lethal weapons, sticks and iron rods. The demonstrators vandalised several vehicles, including two cars of private TV channels, DU registrar building, proctor office and sociology department.

News reports gave information of about 15 persons arrested while more than 55 students were injured in the clashes.

Police and activists of Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL), foiled attempts by protesters to hold prescheduled processions by BCS job seekers on the campuses of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), Dhaka Medical College Hospital and Dhaka University on Friday.

Two cases were filed against 1,700 unidentified government job seekers in connection with the violence on the 11th of July in the city’s Shahbagh area. Officer-in-charge of Shahbagh Police Station Sirajul Islam said that police had filed both the cases — one against 500 people and another against 1,200 — under the Bangladesh Penal Code Act with the police station. Besides, security official of Dhaka University, SM Quamrul Ahsan, also filed a case at Shahbagh police station against 500 students accusing them of vandalism on the campus on Monday night, bringing the total number of accused to 2,200 job seekers.

Police detained 34 people in connection with the violence at Dhaka University on Friday.

Resuming the ongoing agitation over job reservations, a group of students held a demonstration in front of Dhaka University Central Library, demanding revocation of the quota system. Witnesses said leaders of the DU chapter of the Chhatra League disbanded the protesters when they tried to stage a rally on the campus. Soon after the first group dispersed, another group took out a procession holding the banner "Amra Muktijoddhar Shontan". Meanwhile, over 1,000 students of Rajshahi University (RU) demonstrating against the quota provision in public service recruitment blocked the Dhaka-Rajshahi highway since Saturday morning. They started the protest in front of the university’s main gate around 11:00am, halting traffic movement on the highway.

The protesters in a press release announced to observe strike in all educational institutions across the country on Sunday to press home their demands, including cancellation of quota system in all government jobs, withdrawal of lawsuits, unconditional release of detained and arrested persons and justice for the Chhatra League attack on peaceful protesters upon probe.

Anti Quota protests continued at Dhaka University (DU), Chittagong University(CU), Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST) and Rajshahi University(RU). Thousands of students participated in the demonstrations and classes and exams were reportedly suspended at CU and SUST.

From June 11 onwards, the protests spread to other parts of the country as students of Jahangirnagar University, Shahjalal University of Science & Technology at Sylhet, Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU) (Mymensingh), Rajshahi University and Chittagong University decided to express solidarity with Dhaka-based protesters. Students of public universities outside Dhaka took to the streets and formed human chains. They also chanted slogans, blocked highways and held placards and festoons to press home their demands.

The protests have sparked a lot of debate on various social media platforms.

The prime minister’s public administration adviser HT Imam, on speaking with the media said,‘The government has no plans to reform the existing quota system in the civil service exams.'

Dhaka University Proctor Amzad Ali flanked by ruling party Chhatra League men, said, “When they began demonstration yesterday [Wednesday], we were sympathetic to their demand, but today [Thursday] what they are doing indicates that some other forces, maybe from Jamaat-Shibir, have infiltrated them and doing the damage working from inside. These kind of activities are quite unacceptable.” 

Condemning the violence on general students and expressing support with the demands of the anti-quota demonstrators, opposition party BNP acting secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said in a statement.“The government has become so desperate that it does not hesitate to let loose police and Jubo League and Chhatra League cadres to attack students instead of taking their justified demand into consideration,”

An organization called 'Amra Muktijoddhar Sontan' on Friday took stance against the anti-quota protests when it claimed that the anti quota movement was being influenced by Jamaat-e-Islami and Islami Chatra Shibir. “We have taken to the streets to voice our demand for fulfilling quotas in all cadre posts of special BCS (Bangladesh Civil Service). We will not go back until our demands are satisfied,” added the organization's president Humayun Kabir.

Acting Jamaat-e-Islami Secretary Rafiqul Islam Khan, while expressing support for the protests said, "The number of meritorious educated unemployed are rising in the country due to the quota system being effective and acute frustration is forming among the meritorious students and youths. Accepting the demand of the protesting students and youths, this problem should be solved swiftly. But attacking them by police and party cadres without considering their rational demands is very sad and painful. We think quota system needs to be annulled to create skilled and competent administrative leadership."

The Public Service Commission (PSC) on Saturday said the reviewed results of the 34th BCS preliminary test would be published on Sunday. The Commission decided to reverse the decision to apply the quota policy at the 34th BCS preliminary result. However, the quota would still be applied in the later stages.

The Public Service Commission (PSC) on Sunday came up with a reviewed list of 46,250 successful candidates, the highest so far. “These 46,250 candidates include the 12,033 whom we announced as successful in our previous list (earlier published on Tuesday, 9th of July),” said PSC Exam Controller (cadre) AYM Nesar Uddin.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said that her government will make sure that those who were engaged in vandalism demanding cancellation of quota system in public service recruitment will not get any government jobs in future.

“We’ve the pictures, we’ll place them before the PSC before the viva-voce examinations so that these notorious elements can’t get government jobs,” she said in her introductory speech at the Awami League Central Working Committee (ALCWC) meeting at her official residence Ganobhaban.

The romantic comedy film is produced by Star Cinema and is part of its 20th Anniversary presentation. It tells the story of a brainy ugly duckling girl and her journey as she turns into someone who's worth loving. Ramon Bautista also stars in the film as a taxi driver. It is the first movie team up of Kim Chiu and Xian Lim and is directed by Joyce Bernal.

Sandy Veloso (Kim Chiu) is a modern-day ugly duckling who is obsessed with her boyfriend Edgardo (Kean Cipriano). After he breaks with her, Sandy is left to ponder why she feels unwanted.

Matters turn worse for Sandy when she is laid off by her company, under the leadership of its new bachelor CEO, Alex Prieto (Xian Lim). Realizing his mistake when employees belatedly put in a good word for Sandy, Alex hires her back, and the two start forming an unlikely friendship.

In a love story about "the ugly duckling in all of us and how we turn into someone worth loving," Alex at one point even offers Sandy a make-over so she will no longer cry over a failed relationship.



Actors Kim Chiu and Xian Lim became guests to several ABS-CBN TV shows to promote the film. Among these are Gandang Gabi Vice and Banana Split.

Bakit Hindi Ka Crush ng Crush Mo?, sung by Zia Quizon and written by Jungee Marcelo, is the theme song of the movie. It premiered on July 8, 2013 at My Only Radio FM radio station and was released as a single on July 17. It is also included in her second studio album, "A Little Bit of Lovin"'.
