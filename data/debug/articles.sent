protection of life during pregnancy act the protection of life during pregnancy act   act no of  previously bill no of  is an act of the oireachtas which defines the circumstances and processes within which abortion in ireland can be legally performed
the act gives effect in statutory law to the terms of the constitution as interpreted by the supreme court in the  judgment attorney general v x the x case
that judgment allowed for abortion where pregnancy endangers a womans life including through a risk of suicide
the provisions relating to suicide have been the most contentious part of the bill
having passed both houses of the oireachtas in july  it was signed into law on  july by michael d higgins the president of ireland and commenced on  january under section  of the offences against the person act  unlawfully attempting to procure a miscarriage was a crime punishable by up to life imprisonment
a  amendment to the  constitution guarantees to vindicate the right to life of the unborn with due regard for the equal right to life of the mother
proponents of the amendment believed that it would guarantee abortion could never be allowed in any circumstances
however in  the supreme court ruled in attorney general v x that abortion was permitted where pregnancy presented a real and substantial risk to the life as distinct from the health of the mother including where the risk was through suicide
there were two attempts to amend the constitution to explicitly rule out suicide as grounds for abortion
these were rejected at referendums in  and in  some no-voters felt the restriction was too strong and others that it was not strong enough
no legislation was passed to amend the  act in the light of the  judgment

in december the government decided to pursue option  in the expert groups report legislation plus regulations
the act specifies the number and specialty of medical practitioners who must concur that a termination is necessary to prevent a risk of death
these criteria differ in three scenariosthe physicians diagnosis must be an opinion formed in good faith which has regard to the need to preserve unborn human life as far as practicable
normal informed consent is required
medical personnel with conscience objections to abortion will not be required to participate in terminations but must transfer care of a patient in such cases
all terminations must be notified to the minister for health within  days
the minister will make an annual report of such notifications
where a termination is requested but refused a woman may appeal to the health service executive hse
the hse will establish a panel of at least  physicians from whom a committee of two or three will review any application within three days
the committee members specialties will depend on whether the condition is physical or mental in the same way as for the initial assessment
the hse must publish an annual report on the review process
the act also repeals sections  and  of the  act these criminalise attempted or actual procurement of miscarriage and assisting such procurement
it replaces them with a new offence of destruction of unborn human life with a maximum penalty of  years imprisonment
the director of a body corporate which performs such a procedure can be guilty of a similar offence
as required by the constitution the right to travel abroad for abortion th amendment and to provide information about foreign abortion th amendment are protected
the act defines the unborn whose life is protected as existing from implantation in the uterus until complete emergence  from the body of the woman
beginning at implantation conforms to a  supreme court judgment on the beginning of pregnancy rather than the catholic view that personhood begins at conception
the aim of specifying the uterus is to avoid criminalising emergency contraception or treatment of ectopic pregnancy
the act empowers the minister for health to produce regulations detailing the procedures for all its provisions
a senior source at the national maternity hospital nmh told the irish times that terminations had been carried out there prior to the  act and that the change brought about by the act would be to remove the fear of a possible medical council case
except in an emergency a termination can only be carried out in an appropriate institution
the act lists several of these and empowers the minister to specify others
the draft bills list of approved institutions included only maternity hospitals but was extended to include other hospitals with intensive care units where the nearest maternity hospital did not have emergency medicine facilities
the bill was drafted by the government and then introduced by it into the oireachtas or parliament
after both houses of the oireachtas passed it it was signed into law by the president
in january  the oireachtas joint committee on health and children held three days of discussions with interest groups on the governments plans
the meeting was held in the chamber of the seanad upper house rather than a committee room to allow more people to attend
journalist stephen collins commented that it was an unusual and positive step to hold such a discussion before the drafting of a bill by the office of the parliamentary counsel to government
health minister james reilly said in january  that the process had become now the standard for many bills
the draft of the bill was published in april  the official announcement stated that the provisions of the proposed legislation being published were strictly within the parameters of the x case
in may  the oireachtas joint committee on health and children held three days of discussions on the draft bill with healthcare and legal professionals
its report was laid before the dil on  may
the bill was introduced in dil ireann the lower house of the oireachtas on  june  it was the subject of vigorous debate
from the government parties tds terence flanagan peter mathews billy timmins and brian walsh were expelled from the fine gael parliamentary party on  july  after voting against the bills second stage in defiance of a party whip
lucinda creighton was likewise expelled on  july for voting against the bills report stage she was also forced to resign as minister of state for european affairs
michael mcnamara of labour also voted against the bill but the party later explained this had been a mistake
from the opposition parties peadar tibn was suspended by sinn fin for six months after voting no against the whip
while fianna fil leader michel martin favoured the bill the partys tds demanded a free vote and  of  voted against
this contributed to media reports that martins continued leadership of the party was in doubt
six pro-choice technical group tds voted against the bill clare daly joan collins richard boyd barrett mick wallace joe higgins and luke ming flanagan
they argued instead for a referendum to repeal the  constitutional amendment which places the life of the mother and the unborn on an equal footing
boyd barrett criticised the exclusion of fatal foetal abnormality in the bill which he said will force women whose pregnancies will inevitably end in tragedy to go full term or travel overseas for terminations
at the bills report stage  amendments were proposed
faced with such a large number the government decided to let the debate run over the originally allocated time rather than using a guillotine motion to curtail it
such a motion might have prevented discussion of the bills most contentious sections thereby increasing controversy
the report stage began at am on  july and was adjourned at am the following morning
at about am as deputies were awaiting a division tom barry pulled ine collins a fellow fine gael td for cork east onto his lap
barry apologised publicly and was reprimanded by fine gael
he admitted having drunk alcohol before the incident but denied being drunk
some politicians called for an end to the practice of the oireachtas members private bar remaining open and serving alcohol whenever oireachtas business is being conducted
debate resumed at pm that evening and concluded with the final vote at am on the morning of  july
the bill was finally approved by  votes to six days were set aside for the bills passage through the seanad
it was introduced on monday  july  and passed its second stage the next day by  votes to  the no voters were  of the  fianna fil senators independents feargal quinn and rnn mullen taoiseachs nominee mary ann obrien and fidelma healy eames and paul bradford who lost the fine gael whip
jim walsh quoted an anti-abortion pamphlets description of dilation and evacuation which the bills supporters criticised as inappropriate
fianna fils brian  domhnaill claimed that allowing abortions in the case of foetal anomalies would deprive ireland of future special olympics athletes
he also remarked that down syndrome babies could be left to die on sterilised trays
the bill passed its final stage unamended on  july  by  votes to  if the seanad had rejected or amended the bill the dil would have had to be recalled from its summer recess to consider the seanads changes
a bill passed by both houses of the oireachtas is sent to the president of ireland to be signed into law
there were suggestions that the seanad might petition president michael d higgins to call an ordinary referendum on the bill
paschal donohoe suggested higgins might refer the bill to the supreme court under article  of the constitution to test whether it is constitutional
the president is required to summon a meeting of the council of state before any referral and on  july he called such a meeting for  july
of the  members of the council  attended
of the three absentees mary robinson and john bruton both made written submissions the third albert reynolds had alzheimers disease
a bill allowed by the supreme court under article  can never subsequently have its constitutionality challenged in court
news reports suggested that for this reason most members of the council advised the president not to refer the bill to allow the supreme court to consider it in the light of specific future cases rather than abstract hypothetical cases
higgins had until  july  to either sign or refer the bill in the event he signed it on  july without referral
the bill has been criticised by commentators on both sides of the irish abortion debate both for being too restrictive and for not being restrictive enough
jurist gerry whyte listed and critiqued five hypothetical grounds on which the act might be argued to be unconstitutional the lack of explicit time limits the lack of an opt-out for institutions as opposed to individuals with conscience objections the fact that a refused abortion can be appealed but an allowed abortion cannot the lack of allowance for fatal fetal abnormality and the possibility that the x-case judgment is not binding with regard to allowing suicide as grounds
the irish catholic bishops conference wrote a series of pastoral letters condemning the bill
in may  fine gael td tom barry wrote to cardinal sen brady and the nuncio charles john brown asking whether tds would be excommunicated if they voted for the bill
derek keatings parish priest stopped him serving as minister of the eucharist after he voted for the act
pro-life commentators criticised the bills lack of time limits
breda obrien suggested doctors might induce labour of a borderline-viable fetus resulting in permanent health problems associated with premature birth
rnn mullen suggested the prospect of medical malpractice lawsuits from such births might make doctors prefer late-term abortion instead
while the bill was still in progress the department of health published drafts of the statutory instruments for regulations to be introduced by the minister for health
separate regulations deal with certification of appropriate institutions reporting of procedures performed and application for review of refused termination
in august  kevin doran a priest on the board of governors of mater misericordiae university hospital told the irish times it could not comply with the act because of its catholic ethos while a hospital spokesperson said it had not yet formulated a policy on the act
the irish times suggested that opting out was permissible due to the deletion from the bill of an explicit requirement for approved institutions to facilitate terminations
the board held a four-hour meeting on  september and announced on  september that it would comply with the act
doran resigned from the board while a nun on the board said the hospital would not be performing abortions and expressed uncertainty about future decisions
a spokesperson for st vincents university hospital which has religious sisters of charity management said in august it would be following the law of the land
the other approved hospitals are managed by the hse and so will provide facilities as a matter of course
the irish times reported on  august  that the first abortion under the terms of the act had been performed several weeks earlier at the nmh
in fact although the act had been passed it had not commenced
the nmh story was investigated for possible breach of information privacy law
on  august the irish times withdrew its story and stated the case described in the article did not happen
the department of health stated that commencement of the act would not occur until the finalisation of the regulations required to implement its provisions
the department established an expert committee comprising twelve people including ten medical specialists
it first met on  september  and was originally expected to report within three months
one task was appointing doctors to the review and appeals panels required by the act which was accomplished by december
on  december  minister reilly signed several statutory instruments those specifying regulations for certification review and notification of decisions and a commencement order specifying  january  as the date the act and regulations would come into force
separate from the administrative regulations are the clinical guidelines for physicians to determine whether a given case meets the legal criteria specified by the act
these were not in place when the act commenced
there was criticism of the decision to commence the act and regulations before the guidelines have been established
the college of psychiatrists advised members not to participate in assessments for risk of loss of life from suicide until the guidelines had been published
the irish times reported in january  that the guidelines were being drafted by the medical council on  july  it reported that they had been drawn up by the department of health and circulated to healthcare professionals
in august  media reported on ms y who in july had a caesarean section after  weeks gestation despite having requested an abortion and being suicidal
a revised version of the june guidelines was published on  september 
the irish times commented that the guidelines differed from those circulated in july and appear to go further than the act in prescribing c-section and early induction minister for health leo varadkar denied the ms y case had influenced them
the government on  october  made a submission to the council of europe on its response to the a b and c v ireland judgment summarizing the act and ensuing regulations and publicity and stating that the health service executive would be producing a patient information leaflet for women
on  december  the councils committee of ministers closed the case as resolved
in february  clare dalys private members bill to amend the  act to allow abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormality was rejected in the dil the government argued that the bill was unconstitutional which daly disputed
the first annual report on the acts operation was laid before the dil on  june  by the minister for health
the report revealed that in  there had been  terminations in the state under the acts provisions of which three were on grounds of risk of suicide

capture of fricourtfricourt is a village that was fought over during the battle of the somme which took place in france during the first world war in july  fricourt is from albert north of bray and west of mametz near the d  road and at the junction of the d  with the d  the village is north-east of amiens and on the route of the albertpronne light railway
fricourt wood was north-east of the village with a chteau on the edge of the village and a number of craters known as the tambour  to the germans on the west side
fricourt formed a salient in the german front-line and was the principal german fortified village between the river somme and the ancre
the ground sloped south-west from bazentin ridge divided by willow stream which rose in trnes wood and flowed past the ends of the mametz and fricourt spurs
the stream was the inner boundary of the th division on the right and the st division on the left of the xv corps
german fortification of the area around mametz and fricourt had created a web of trenches deep behind the front-line trench which was irregular making many angles from which an attacker could be engaged
on  june  the artillery preparation began for the anglo-french offensive the fricourt area was subjected to several british gas attacks during the bombardment
several mines were detonated just before on  july when british infantry attack on the german defences either side of the village began
by the end of  july the village had been enveloped on three sides and during the night the german garrison withdrew towards the second position
british patrols reported the retirement overnight and at noon on  july troops of the th division occupied the village and captured fricourt wood in the mid-afternoon
the th baden reserve division which held the front from montauban to fricourt and ovillers was saved from destruction by reinforcements from the th bavarian division
the rd guard division was hurried forward from valenciennes to hold the ground in front of the second position and british attacks began on shelter and bottom woods up the slope towards contalmaison
xv corps had more than on  july of which the th battalion west yorkshire regiment suffered the worst of the battalions engaged on the first day xv corps took the german army arrived at fricourt on  september  when the th wrttemberg reserve division and the th  reserve division of the xiv reserve corps tried to continue an advance westwards towards amiens
by  october temporary scrapes had been occupied after a night attack turned into a fiasco and soldiers were captured
fighting in the area from the somme north to the ancre subsided into minor line-straightening attacks by both sides
in december the french attacked all along the new western front which around fricourt from cost both sides thousands of casualties
in  the war around the village went underground with mining and counter-mining
in the village of la boisselle just north of fricourt were blown between april  and january  at the end of july  fresh troops were observed moving into the french positions north of the somme and were identified on  august at thiepval wood as british soldiers dressed in brown suits
in january  erich von falkenhayn the german chief of the general staff had issued instructions on defensive policy which required the existing front line to be made capable of being easily defended by small numbers of troops
positions lost in the front line were to be recaptured by counter-attack and a second trench was to be built behind the front trench to shelter the front garrison during bombardments
to evade shell-fire on the area behind the front line communication trenches were to be dug through which the troops in the second trench could move forward
behind the front position a new position was to be dug beyond enemy field-artillery range to hold up an attack which had broken through the first line while a counter-attack was mounted
a new line could be formed and linked to the occupied flanks of the first position restricting an attacker to a bend in the line rather than a breakthrough if counter-attacks failed
construction of these defences took much of  and since the front line was to be held at all costs the forward position was completed first
on  may another defensive position was ordered to be built behind the front line
in july  the french commander in chief joseph joffre held the first inter-allied conference at chantilly and in december  a second conference resolved to conduct simultaneous attacks by the french russian british and italian armies
for the british flanders was the main theatre of operations but in february  haig accepted joffres plan for a combined attack astride the somme river to begin around  july
in april the british cabinet accepted the necessity of an offensive in france
the nature of a joint offensive on the somme began to change almost immediately when the german army began the verdun offensive on  february
in march foch had proposed an offensive on a front between lassigny and the somme and a british attack on a front from the somme to thiepval with and divisions
french divisions intended for the joint offensive were diverted to verdun and the offensive was eventually reduced to a main effort by the british with a supporting attack by one french army
british planning for the offensive began in april with a fourth army proposal for a methodical advance to the high ground around thiepval and thence to the bapaumepronne road
haig rejected the concept and required the british objective on the somme to be the capture of the ridge north of pronne to assist the french cross the somme further south
diversion of french divisions to verdun and the assumption by the british of the main role in the somme offensive led to revisions of the plan towards a more ambitious attempt at strategic attrition by a breakthrough and a battle of manoeuvre with distant objectives
around fricourt the original temporary german scrapes and trenches were elaborated according to falkenhayns instructions with concrete used to give shell-proof protection
lines of trenches were dug to link the village fortifications and improved by second and third trenches behind the front line creating a first position
the barbed wire entanglement was doubled to two belts about apart
the front line had two support trenches further back the to accommodate the front garrison and the third for local reserves
dug-outs had been deepened to and an intermediate line of strong points the was built further back
the second reserve line had been built beyond field artillery range and the building of a third line another further back had begun in february  in the first half of  as signs of an anglo-french offensive on the somme multiplied more defensive works were built all over the somme front and raiding was increased to snatch prisoners for questioning
in late may  a spoiling attack was planned from foucaucourt on the south bank of the somme north to st pierre divion intended to reach a depth of 
an attack was made impossible on  june when the forces to carry it out were sent to russia to counter the brusilov offensive
the british method of attack by  was to fire an intense bombardment on the german front trenches just before zero hour then lift the bombardment to the next trench then the next according to a timetable
before the barrage lifted infantry were to creep as close as possible to the bombardment considered to be from the trench and to attack as soon as the shell-fire lifted
the destructive effect of the bombardment was said by haig and rawlinson to be such that nothing could live in the target area and that infantry would only have to occupy the ground
it was recommended that the infantry should attack from trenches no further than from the german front line
the digging of such trenches was opposed by some divisional commanders lest it alerted the defenders and the decision was delegated to corps and divisional commanders
some divisions dug advanced trenches but most expected to begin the advance across no mans land covered by the barrage
in the xv corps area both divisions were to attack behind a creeping barrage and begin the advance from various points some from support trenches behind the british front line due damage caused by german artillery-fire and mining and some from no mans land after crawling forward just before the end of the bombardment
xv corps was commanded by lieutenant-general horne with the th st and th divisions five artillery groups and a siege battery on a front of  about one heavy gun every and one field gun per 
the infantry attack was to be made behind a creeping barrage in which the would slowly move their fire beyond the german front trench at intervals as the heavy artillery lifted from objective to objective when the creeping barrage reached it
if infantry caught up with the creeping barrage they were to take cover and attack when the barrage moved forward
air co-operation for xv corps was to come from  squadron and  squadron royal flying corps rfc
in the first stage of the corps plan the divisions were to occupy higher ground either side of willow stream and beyond mametz on the right then take fricourt in the next stage moving through the first german intermediate position to the second intermediate position across the valley fronting mametz wood
the right was to gain contact with the xiii corps at white trench and the left link with iii corps at quadrangle trench below contalmaison
the final objective was chosen to receive a counter-attack with good artillery observation in front of dead ground from which the artillery could bombard the german second position
if the german defence collapsed the th division in corps reserve would pass through and advance beyond mametz wood up the north side of caterpillar valley to bazentin le grand longueval and ginchy
fricourt was not to be attacked frontally but isolated for which the right hand brigade of the th division was to take mametz and then white trench the centre brigade was to form a defensive flank on the south rise of willow valley which faced fricourt and fricourt wood to the north
the inner brigades of the th division and st division were to wait in the front-line trenches opposite the village until ordered forward by the corps commander
at an intensive bombardment was to begin and from gas was to be released at the centre of the front opposite fricourt at a hurricane bombardment from stokes mortars was to begin and at a smoke-screen would be generated to screen the inner flanks of the th and st divisions and cloud the german support line opposite the th division
as part of the mines on the first day of the somme three mines of  and were to be blown at under the tambour to create crater lips to protect the st division infantry from machine-guns at german tambour
bulgar point near mametz was mined with a charge a sap further west mined with a charge and four mines were planted south of hidden wood
the th reserve division faced xv corps with the i and iii battalions reserve infantry regiment  which had in shell-hole positions and the ii battalion in reserve opposite the british th division
the regiment was due for relief on the night of but the extent of british artillery-fire kept infantry regiment  back near montauban
deep dug-outs had been built in the front line but few had been dug further back which led to the trench garrison being crowded in the first trench
the divisional artillery an essential part of the defence plan was smashed up by british artillery-fire
reserve infantry regiment  held the sector opposite the british st division
the right and centre brigades of the division attacked on a front from the carnoymametz track to a quarry near hidden wood
the th brigade in the centre was to wheel left to form a line from the north-west corner of mametz to the south-west along orchard alley across the maricourt road with the left near bois franais linking with the nd brigade which waited for the order to advance
the right-hand battalion of the th brigade advanced from an area behind the front line due to damage in the front line trenches and was devastated in no mans land by machine-gun fire from fricourt wood and the german support trench
the bombardment of fricourt failed due to the howitzer shell fuzes falling out before the shells reached the target
the survivors pressed on and entered the front trench south of fricourt and some parties reached the support trench further on and overpowered the german troops in adjacent communication trenches
advancing further was impossible but the battalion continued to snipe and bomb the germans opposite as the flanking battalions advanced
reinforcements later in the morning were also caught by machine-gun fire in no mans land and the survivors were unable to make progress beyond the existing th brigade position
the left-hand battalion crossed no mans land with far fewer casualties and wheeled left to hidden lane beyond hidden wood and short of apple alley up the slope
small parties mopped up german troops among the craters and mine shafts in the area taking hidden lane by despite losses from german troops in mametz and hidden wood
the wood was captured by a frontal attack combined with bombers moving down hidden lane before parties advanced to the objective at apple alley
establishment of the defensive flank towards fricourt was not possible but the nd brigade managed to occupy the german front and support trenches near the village and gain touch with the th brigade
the division attacked with the th brigade attached from the th division on the right and the rd and th brigades to the left with the nd brigade in reserve
the th brigade was to be ready to attack fricourt if the enveloping attacks on the flanks failed except for the left-hand battalion which was to attack to form a defensive flank facing the village
the st division brigades were to advance to the first objective at crucifix trench the german intermediate line and then continue to the second objective at bottom wood and quadrangle trench in the second german intermediate line to link with troops from the th division
the th battalion west yorkshire regiment attacked on a front of and the first two companies reached the german front trench with few casualties then pressed on to red cottage at the north end of fricourt
the rest of the battalion was caught by machine-guns in the village and german tambour which had survived the mine explosions and were forward of the creeping barrage
the two companies were practically annihilated and only a few troops reached the front trench
the companies at red cottage were overrun later in the morning only a few groups managing to reach the rd brigade to the north
the companies in no mans land were pinned down until dark and the battalion lost  the worst battalion loss of the first day
the two st division brigades had to move up the west slope of the fricourt spur then advance across the dip and the first fricourtcontalmaison road to the first objective at crucifix trench on the east slope of fricourt spur
the right flank was to advance to fricourt farm and the left to round wood south of scots redoubt
the two leading battalions of the rd brigade had many casualties in no mans land half of the right-hand battalion advanced five minutes before zero hour to crawl across no mans land but were forced back by machine-gun fire
the survivors formed one line to advance again at zero and were swept by fire from six machine-guns before reaching the german support trench forty survivors then followed the barrage to the sunken road
the two support companies were also caught in no mans land and only reached the front trench where the troops consolidated and defeated three counter-attacks from fricourt
the left-hand battalion also tried to creep into no mans land and was fired on but continued to advance and the survivors reached the front trench preceded by a shower of grenades and bombed forward to the support trench
the supporting battalions were to advance at to pass through to the second objective when the creeping barrage moved on but the german opposition to the leading battalions led to the supporting battalions being sent to reinforce the first objective at despite machine-gun fire sweeping no mans land the survivors reached the top of fricourt spur on the right reaching the sunken road where a standing barrage was falling before being stopped by machine-gun fire from fricourt and the wood on the right
the left battalion reached the leading troops and bombed along communication trenches occupying lozenge alley up to the sunken road to secure their right flank
other parties advanced up the road to crucifix trench and more probed towards fricourt farm before retiring
german bombers counter-attacked towards sunken road but were repulsed and the british built a strong point in lonely trench
royal engineers intended to build more posts were pressed into service as infantry instead to hold the right flank of the brigade
the th brigade front had a small salient at each end between which a russian sap had secretly been dug
the sap was exposed just before the attack so that the british troops could attack in a straight line from the far side of the wire
during the intense bombardment in the last five minutes before zero hour companies of the two leading battalions crept forward from the sap as german machine-gunners ignored the bombardment to set up their guns on the parapet and machine-gunners on higher ground near la boisselle swept no mans land and the ground behind the german front trench
when the hurricane bombardment stopped the battalions stood up and advanced through the german wire despite many casualties and took the trench as german troops showered them with stick-grenades
the two supporting battalions followed close behind and all four rushed the german support trench and took in ten minutes half of both leading battalions becoming casualties
the advance continued when the creeping barrage moved on across the top of the spur towards sunken road as german parties and the leading troops engaged with bombs and bayonets
the sunken road was reached at after crossing of open ground
a halt was called but some troops pressed on to crucifix trench and took from shelter wood prisoner
fire from fricourt wood shelter wood and birch tree wood made an advance to the second objective impractical as the creeping barrage had moved on
the brigade commander went forward and placed troops on the open left flank where the th division of iii corps was to have reached
more troops were sent forward to crucifix trench and lewis-gunners sent to lozenge wood to the south
brigadier-general headlam led an attack on round wood to the north but most of the attackers were hit by machine-gun fire from the wood
a post was formed at the junction of crucifix trench and the sunken road and the wood was occupied at when the garrison left the wood to counter-attack troops from the th division who had lost direction and approached the wood from the west
the existing positions were consolidated and headlam returned to divisional headquarters by and obtained two battalions from the reserve brigade
the reinforcements struggled through congested trenches and eventually took over the right of the rd brigade and left of the th brigade
at midday xv corps headquarters had gained an exaggerated view of the success of the offensive xiii corps on the right had reported that the germans were in full retreat to bazentin le grand and iii corps had announced that its troops were advancing towards contalmaison
air observers reported that german artillery was withdrawing along the albertbapaume road and that british infantry had been seen between fricourt and contalmaison
air observers also saw flares lit by british troops below which were reported promptly
on the right of xv corps kite balloon section was able to order a bombardment on a party of germans who had counter-attacked danzig alley which was so effective that a renewed british attack took it easily
horne ordered the third phase to commence unaware that not all of the first phase objectives had been reached and set zero hour for after a thirty-minute bombardment
the nd brigade of the th division waiting south of fricourt attacked with battalions and the leading companies got across no mans land with few losses
the support companies were caught by machine-gun fire from the left the detachments having been intended to bomb down communication trenches to willow valley and fricourt being nearly annihilated
a small party reached the rectangle was bombed back to the support trench and all attempts to press forward again were met with more machine-gun fire from the left an attempt to bomb forward along trenches also failed
the left-hand battalion bombed up sunken road trench and both sides of the rectangle to apple alley and briefly gained a foothold in fricourt which distracted the german defenders on the right where touch was also gained with the th brigade troops in apple alley
the th brigade attacked north of the willow stream the plan being changed after the th west yorkshires were destroyed in the morning
the right-hand battalion attacked at after protesting that the attack would fail unless the objective attacked earlier by the th west yorkshires was taken first
the second stage was ordered despite the failure of the first stage against the most fortified part of the fricourt defences between wing corner below the southern tip of the village and german tambour in front of the western face
the preliminary bombardment failed to cut the wire due to faulty fuzes and only small gaps were made german dug-outs in the area were left untouched
the battalion was engaged from both flanks as soon as it advanced despite covering fire from lewis guns on the railway embankment nearby
in three minutes had been inflicted some german troops standing on the parapet to fire
a small number of british troops reached the village and were overrun and killed or captured except for one party which occupied a cellar
the survivors in no mans land were pinned down until dark and a support battalion which followed the advance was also cut down in no mans land the th brigade attack was suspended
as the third phase attack by the centre brigades collapsed the outer brigades of both divisions consolidated their hold on mametz and fricourt spurs
on the th division front the last company of the right-hand battalion of the th brigade advanced at and despite being caught by machine-gun fire from the shrine arrived in time to exploit the attack on fricourt at the th brigade was reinforced by part of a supporting battalion to attack through mametz towards bunny trench past troops who had already worked forward into the east end of the village
four lines advanced at after a bombardment
as they approached the village about troops emerged from dugouts at the shrine and mametz to surrender and by the village was captured after a last stand by the garrison
the troops reached bunny trench to complete the first phase of the th brigade plan
from the centre of the divisional front facing fricourt the line ran from the north-west corner of mametz left to the slope along orchard alley across the pronne road and light railway along apple alley to the maricourt spur joining the right of the nd brigade in the german first and support lines
on the st division front little ground was gained during the afternoon but a defensive flank was established against fricourt
the rd and th brigades had been ordered to exploit the attack on the village at to advance from the sunken road and crucifix trench to fricourt farm and shelter wood the rd brigade to be ready to intercept a retreat from fricourt
on the brigade front attempted movement was met with machine-gun fire from fricourt farm and the north side of fricourt wood
an attack by the th brigade was carried out in a rush when the order arrived ten minutes after the bombardment on shelter wood had lifted and the attack from crucifix trench by parts of two battalions failed
at the divisional commander major-general campbell ordered both brigades to consolidate the line running from willow stream in the british front line to opposite german tambour the german front trench on the left of the th brigade the rd brigade to consolidate along lonely lane lozenge alley and lozenge wood facing fricourt
to the north the th brigade held a line from lozenge wood the first intermediate line crucifix trench to round wood where touch had been gained with the th division
at campbell ordered the last two battalions of the nd brigade forward to relieve the th brigade at dawn on  july
at the th division was ordered to take over from the st division facing fricourt the th brigade being relieved by the st brigade ready for another attack in the morning as observers and patrols had reported retirements by the germans in the area of fricourt
an opportunity to attack when the german defence was still disorganised was lost when the arrival of the st brigade was held up by congestion behind the british front line until very little german firing took place on the st division front overnight many wounded were recovered and supplies were brought up without interference although there was an acute water shortage in the captured area
at rawlinson ordered the offensive to continue in the xv corps area to take fricourt advance to the final objective and to link with iii corps south of contalmaison
the front around fricourt remained quiet during the night and a german counter-attack further south at maricourt was repulsed
horne ordered an attack on fricourt at on  july after a bombardment the th division to link with the th division north of mametz
soon afterwards a th division patrol reported that fricourt had been entered unopposed at midnight
a patrol from the st brigade took from reserve infantry regiment  and major-general pilcher ordered the brigade to enter the village immediately
in the confusion the village was not occupied until noon on  july where eleven german stragglers were captured
the attack continued behind a creeping barrage with bottom wood as the final objective
the advance moved through fricourt wood where fallen trees thick undergrowth and german machine-gun fire slowed progress
by nightfall touch had been gained with the th division on the right and along the north and north-eastern fringes of fricourt wood and fricourt farm at the junction with the st division
observers in aircraft on contact patrol followed the attack and reported the fall of the farm minutes afterwards
railway alley was relatively undamaged but bombers attacked from the west and took just before midnight
the preliminary bombardment was particularly effective on the front of the th reserve division and was more destructive on  july when the artillery batteries in the valleys near montauban and mametz were destroyed along with their ammunition few of the guns being withdrawn to the second position
all the field guns of the th reserve division were put out of action and reports described the bombardment as devastating
much of the garrison was in the front line where most of the dug-outs had been built
telephone communication was cut and machine-guns in danzig alley north of mametz were destroyed or made inoperable
scattered resistance in mametz continued at and the last survivors retired at as soon as the attack began two battalions of infantry regiment  and every available man from reserve infantry regiment  were sent to the second position
reinforcements were not sent forward to the front line due to uncertainty about the fighting at montauban
opposite the st division reserve infantry regiment  had many casualties in the bombardment and most trenches obstacles shallow dug-outs and observation posts were destroyed although a few dug-out entrances were kept clear
on fricourt spur the situation was worse and the northernmost company of reserve infantry regiment  was reduced to mine explosions west of fricourt at the tambour caused much destruction and the th company of reserve infantry regiment  left a machine-gun crew behind withdrew and was replaced by the nd company which was outflanked attacked from behind and all the personnel killed or captured
a replacement company failed to reach the area but took cover in round wood where it repulsed the first th brigade attack
by evening the survivors withdrew towards the shoelace makers cave an elaborate dug-out near fricourt wood
machine-guns in the second position failed to work and local counter-attacks were not able to retrieve the situation as the british advance around mametz outflanked the garrison in fricourt where the defence was hampered by fog gas and smoke
a british attack west of the tambour was countered by a defensive mine which inflicted many casualties on the st division as it attacked along with machine-gun fire from the hill above fricourt
in the area of reserve infantry regiment  the attack began with the sound of the mine explosions on the right flank the effect of the british bombardment had already been sufficient to require the relief of two companies due on the evening of  july from infantry regiment  the damage caused by the bombardment the narrowness of no mans land and the surprise of the russian sap allowed the british to break in while most of the garrison was under cover
an instant counter-attack failed and the defence was pushed back within minutes one company being back in the third trench by on the left flank the iii battalion was also pushed back despite attempts by the ii battalion to reinforce the defence
the defeat of the th division around montauban had uncovered the southern flank and during the afternoon constant attacks gradually wore down the defence
at the headquarters of the iii battalion was captured and by the rallied at the second position at bazentin le petit
during the night orders from below arrived for the garrison of fricourt to withdraw which was accomplished relatively easily as the british attack had stopped
reinforcements from iii battalion reserve infantry regiment  were sent to the area of reserve infantry regiment  in the evening of  july and were all killed or captured along with the remnants of reserve infantry regiment  as the british advanced from fricourt and mametz towards mametz wood
the xv corps attack took a considerable amount of ground on the flanks the right advancing and the left  in the centre the attack failed and although enveloped on three sides fricourt was not captured
in prior and wilsons account the salient around fricourt made the village inherently vulnerable to artillery-fire in enfilade
the failure to engage in counter-battery fire by xv corps was redeemed by the emphasis on it by xiii corps artillery to the south and the french guns of xx corps which wiped out the german artillery near fricourt
the density of the destructive bombardment was much greater than elsewhere and a lack of deep dug-outs led to most of the defenders congregating in dug-outs under the front trench which reduced the capacity of the surviving german infantry to withstand the attack
prior and wilson described the failure of the tactical ploy of infantry moving into no mans land before zero hour and the catastrophe of the th brigade attack in the afternoon after xv corps received inaccurate reports from xiii and iii corps
c t atkinson the th division historian wrote that the success of the th th and th divisions partly made up for the failures further north and that with the ground gained by the st division the plan to envelop fricourt and link the inner flanks of the divisions was completed on  july
the infantry advance took four minutes to reach the empty british front line which had been bombarded by german artillery during the intense fire in the hour before zero and were taken in mametz
the afternoon attack of the th brigade achieved an advance sufficient to guard the left flank of the division and during the day the th divisional artillery fired of field gun ammunition and in the early morning orders for a resumption of attacks to the final objective were issued as patrols found fricourt undefended took a number of prisoners and met troops of the th division in willow trench taking many prisoners
most of the xv corps casualties were inflicted by machine-gun fire the th division losing  the st division having and the th brigade th division the th battalion west yorkshire regiment had the greatest number of casualties of any battalion engaged on the first day
were taken and reserve infantry regiment  had not all incurred on the xv corps front
the advances achieved by the british south of the albertbapaume road continued after  july with the occupation of fricourt on  july and an advance across caterpillar valley where the ground rose in  with more artillery being concentrated on a narrower front and shallower objectives being set
operations were intended to close on the german second line and threaten the rear of the german defences from ovillers to thiepval ready for another general attack from longueval to bazentin le petit which required the capture of the intermediate german defences in front of mametz wood and contalmaison
some of the survivors of the defence of fricourt and reinforcements which began to arrive on  july took over the intermediate line from mametz wood to la boisselle
late on  july xv corps ordered an attack by the th and st divisions to begin at on  july to capture shelter and bottom woods south of contalmaison as the th division attacked towards mametz wood
fricourt was recaptured by german troops on  march  during the retreat of the th division and the st dismounted brigade of the st cavalry division during operation michael the german spring offensive
the th division minus the th brigade collected round fricourt
german troops assumed that the british were being routed attacked the st brigade which had been reduced to about frontally and incurred losses which were considered to be the worst in the march battles
during the afternoon the village was captured and cubbons composite brigade assembled from rear area personnel and stragglers filled the gap between fricourt wood and the dismounted cavalry by the nd brigade occupied fricourt and managed to stop the german advance but on  march a general retirement of the v corps divisions was ordered and the viialge was evacuated at in the afternoon air reconnaissance saw that the british defence of the line from montauban and ervillers was collapsing and the rfc squadrons in the area made a maximum effort to disrupt the german advance
the village was recaptured for the last time on  august by the th division during the second battle of bapaume
